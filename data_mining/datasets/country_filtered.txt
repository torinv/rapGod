Every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey

Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass sand on her feet
I cant help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldnt get any hotter you slid on in
Said Im a little hot and bothered if you know what I mean
Lets crank it up to a hundred degrees

You hit me like fire shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot two shot Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey

I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look you licked them lips
I said Hang on baby better pull over for this
I dont wanna get DWK driving while kissing theyll put you away

You hit me like fire shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey
Its like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot two shot Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me its like sunshine and whiskey
Hall I smile when I think about
And too little sleep Once upon a time you were my world but youll always be my Summertime Girl
Goes Lord knows we had a good run
And too little sleep Once upon a time you were my world but youll always be my Summertime Girl
Again And when those bluebonnets bloom it reminds me of you down on that riverwalk On that forth of July let those
Fireworks fly With willie and the boys Down in Luckenbach
And too little sleep Once upon a time you were my world but youll always be my Summertime Girl
Youll always be my Summertime Girl
Oh oh oh ohohohho

Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well the trouble with up is theres always a down
First Im holding your hand and were on the boardwalk
Theres heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live whatever I do
As great as it is you know whats a bummer
I aint ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby its true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I aint gonna beat
No way Im gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it its all gonna stop
Theyll be rolling up windows and puttin up tops
Be a cold wind blowin the leaves through the air
And you wont find a tan line anywhere

Baby I know that it aint over yet
So lets make the most of what we have left
But its hard living for this moment were in and
Knowing its all gonna end

And as long I live whatever I do whatever I do
As great as it is you know whats a bummer
I aint ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby its true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I aint gonna beat
No way Im gonna beat this summer with you

Yeah looking at you girl standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell youll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby I can tell

As long I live as long as I live whatever I do whatever I do
As great as it is you know whats a bummer
I aint ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby its true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I aint gonna beat
No way Im gonna beat this summer with you
Its a tractor firin up
Kids playin in a field
Four wheels gettin stuck
A line singin out a fishin reel
Its a cooler slidin in the bed of a truck
A tin roof drippin rain
Your baby sayin come pick me up
Take me down to the riverbank

These are sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
Its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Cant you hear it coming alive
Makes you wanna drop it down a gear
And kill a couple of beers
Been waiting all year now its finally here
Back around these are the sounds of summer

Its the flick of a lighter lighting up a little smoke
Boots climbing barbwire a little spot nobody goes
Lawn chairs breaking out in the yard to the firework boom
Hearing a heart beating in the dark saying that she wants to

These are sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
Its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Cant you hear it coming alive
Makes you wanna drop it down a gear
And kill a couple of beers
Been waiting all year now its finally here
Back around these are the sounds of summer
Yeah the sounds of summer

Round here thats what its all about
So listen up and look around
Its who we are its what we love
So tonight lets crank em up

These sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
Its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Cant you hear it coming alive
It goes way too fast it all disappears
And when its gone well still be here
Hanging round missing the sounds of summer
Missing the sounds of summer
Missing the sounds of summer
The sounds of summer
Yeah the sounds of summer
In the mornin on a Saturday I got my girls and were skippin town
In my   got the rag top down
Aldeans on the radio aint it funny how they sing along
Makes you smile just a little bit because its not a Miley Cyrus song

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loadin up and livin right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin holes
Sand castles and the fishin poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer

Now were at our little getaway Zoe go and grab the fishin poles
I cant think of any other better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh trapper on the wheel tonight cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise another story I can tell

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loadin up and livin right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin holes
Sand castles and the fishin poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer

Monday mornin and its gettin late
Theres no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldeans on the radio
And my three girls know every line

And these are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loadin up and livin right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the musics right
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin holes
Sand castles and fishin poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer night

You know Tommy going to trick his truck
Jack it up big time
Lift kit chrome tip
Spit shining like a diamond
Game changed and the rain came
And we took it down a back road
Georgia clay mud hole that is how these boys roll
Now it is late night underneath the moonlight
Everybody is feeling right sipping on a bud light
Go on drop your tailgate turn up your radio
Ima build a bonfire you can make yourself at home

Kick back relax you know we are just a bunch o hillbillies
Tip back a cup a Jack and throw your hands up with me

Hey we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby that is alright
It is our backwoods boondocks roots it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah it is just what we do

You see Tommy called Jenny
And Jenny going to call the hotties
To tell them about the party
So do not forget the Bacardi
Time to get your buzz on and your love on
All night long
And if you play your hand right
You would not have to go home alone
Six string picking solo cup sipping
And when the moments right
Grab your phone and get them digits
Cranking that Bocephus we all good with Jesus
Come Sunday morning that preacher he about to preach it
Kick back relax and pass the good time moonshine
Who brought the party Damn that was Florida Georgia Line

Hey we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby that is alright
It is our backwoods boondocks roots it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah it is just what we do
Now I aint sayin them LA ladies dont know what theyre doing
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields Id love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls they talk nice and slow with

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Dont you know
Aint nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
Well dance all night long

A southern girls mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girls probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
Shell get a little hay in her hair her tires in the mud
Shes been caught in the rain and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Dont you know
Aint nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

If youve ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well then fellas come on you know what Im talking about

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Dont you know
Aint nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
Well dance all night long
You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day
Tell you how Im going to take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why Im always running away
I dont know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you til you feel the truth
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why Im always running away
I dont know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

Well I never met a girl like you

To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to

Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there wont be anyone watching

Now there aint nothing wrong baby you and I
Getting down to some up all night

Now dont forget your flipflops

Cause you know were gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

So baby lets go take a dirt road
Kick it back find a good song on the radio
Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there wont be anyone watching

Getting down to some up all night

Come Monday Ill be back to working and saving
But until then yeah

Baby lets go take a dirt road

Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there wont be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there aint nothing wrong baby you and I
Getting down to some up all night
Yeah me and you oh
Up all night yeah
A yellow two piece black Ray Bans
Your bare feet covered in sand
White jet trails across the blue sky
Your ponytail showing off the sunshine
Like a postcard out of nowhere
You get to me you give me that smile and

Im somewhere somewhere sunny and 
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah Im so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 
It doesnt take much for you to move me
Just the way youre leaning into me
Its a holiday when were together
I wanna stay with you forever

Somewhere somewhere sunny and 
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah Im so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 
Youre like the fast lane West bound
You feel like a windows rolled down
I cant wait until we get there somewhere
Chorus
Somewhere sunny and 
You and me on a beach chair

Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and

One on the wheel one around you baby

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin off the cross hangin from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin in your hair blowin round
Youre scanning through the stations lookin for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go nowhere to be

I got my shades on top back
Rollin with the music jacked
One on the wheel one around you baby
Sunset I bet theres a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now dont spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight lets get to killin it
Long as Im rockin with you girl

Pour it on easy now dont spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight lets get to killin it
Long as Im rockin with you girl
You know Im cool with
Just chillin it

Yeah I love rockin with you and girl
Were just chillin it
Shes a little complicated
Shell make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waitin waitin around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
Shes always reapplying her lipstick
The muddy river bank shes the first in and last out
Shes got something I cant figure out
That everybodys talking about
Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring shes never the same
Shes sunny one minute then shes pouring down rain
And shell do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaws gonna drop
And I do but I dont want her to stop
I want I want I want whatever shes got
I want whatever shes got
Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin every weekend
And every penny youve been keepin
Just to figure out what shes thinkin when youre thinkin its love
Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring shes never the same
Shes sunny one minute then shes pouring down rain
And shell do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaws gonna drop
And I do but I dont want her to stop
I want I want I want whatever shes got
I want whatever shes got
Shes got me hangin on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring shes never the same
I want I want I want I want I want

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring shes never the same
Shes sunny one minute then shes pouring down rain
And shell do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaws gonna drop
And I do but I dont want her to stop
I want I want I want whatever shes got
I want whatever shes got
Shes a little bit complicated
Thats alright
Doesnt matter Ill keep on waiting
For whatever shes got
For whatever shes got
When I got the news today
I didnt know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Cant believe youre really gone
Dont feel like going home

So Im gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon but the good Lord knows
The reasons why I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it dont make sense
I cant make it all make sense

So Im gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend

And all the times that we used to

Sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer yeah

Wish I could reach up and reset that sun
Reverse these wheels go back and repick you up
Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine
Oh

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again
So good so right this is one night Im wishing I could rewind

I turn back that radio dial reopen your door
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore
Respin you around replay that sound of you laughing when we hit the ground
I can see it now how bout we

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again
So good so right this is one night Im wishing I could rewind

I wanna refall and refly
Baby relive this night

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again
So good so right this is one night Im wishing I could rewind

Im wishing I could rewind
I wanna relive this night
So good so right
It happened on a Sunday
Outside and the sun was shinning
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words
But they were so hard to find
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you
Ill bring you back Ill bring you back
Ill bring you back to love I will
Bring you back Ill bring you back
Ill bring you back to love

I kissed your tears all falling down
I said baby youll always be the one
Im never going to turn around
Yourre all the life that I have in these lungs
We can all be scared to death
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment that your heart gave up on us


I remember that night at your mamas house
We were so in love finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees
Said youre the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the aisle I remember it now
I remember your smile


Ill bring you back to love
So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what I dont love you feels like
It aint the middle of the night
And it aint even raining outside
It aint exactly what I had in mind for goodbye

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say dont even try
Some are coming home some are leaving town
While my worlds crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

I thought she was gonna say
Something bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said its over didnt try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say dont even try
Some are coming home some are leaving town
While my worlds crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

Theres a mama calming down a little baby
In the backseat in front of me
Theres an old man dressed in his Sunday best
Just waiting on green
But I cant see getting past

This red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say dont even try
Some are coming home some are leaving town
While my worlds crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say dont even try
Some are coming home some are leaving town
While my worlds crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
Hey old friend thanks for callin
Its good to know somebody cares
Yeah shes gone but I dont feel like talkin
It might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she aint worth it

Cause you dont know her like I do
Youll never understand
You dont know weve been through
That girls my best friend
And theres no way youre gonna help me
Shes the only one who can
No you dont know how much Ive got to lose
You dont know her like I do

I cant forget Im drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I cant cope its like a death inside the family
Its like she stole my way to breathe
So dont try to tell me Ill stop hurting
Dont try to tell me she aint worth it

Cause you dont know her like I do
Youll never understand
You dont know weve been through
That girls my best friend
And theres no way youre gonna help me
Shes the only one who can
No you dont know how much Ive got to lose
You dont know her like I do
Cause you dont know her like I do
Youll never understand
You dont know weve been through
That girls my best friend
And theres no way youre gonna help me
Shes the only one who can
No you dont know how much Ive got to lose
You dont know her like I do

Not like I do
Never understand
That girls my best friend
That girls my best friend
That girls my best friend
She says
Look baby Im a rock star
Grabs my old guitar
Playin it upside down
Dancin around
In front of our tv
I cant see the ballgame
So I just wave my lighter and say
Yeah rock on baby
Id rather watch you anyway

But when youre done
Can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that zeppelin shirt of mine youre wearin
Ill never wash that thing again

Yeah and shes my kinda crazy
The little games she plays
Lord theyll never get old
Shes too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits

Pokin out her lip and bitin mine when we kiss
There aint a fight that she cant win
Thats my baby
And shes my kinda crazy

You ought to see her in my pickup
Shes gotta have that radio up
Bless her heart she cant sit still
Head in my lap bare feet on the windshield
Says Cmon baby let me drive

Now honey its a stick shift
Remember what you did last time
Oh

She never lets me rest
She keeps me up all night
Known to roll me off the bed
And steal the covers off my side

But I hear Wake up sleepy head
And I open up my eyes
And its all worth the while
Thats my baby
And shes my kinda crazy
Id sell my soul just to see your face
And Id break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out
And Im starting to lose my faith

But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
Im sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I cant go another day without you
Would it make you make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

My hearts on my sleeve but its turning black
I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone
Without your touch Im not gonna last
I know you know that I need ya just to carry on
It feels like my walls are caving in
Youd always hold me before I left you hanging on
And Ill do anything to have you here again

But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
Im sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I cant go another day without you
Would it make you make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

Yeah the days are cold
The nights are long
I cant stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you
And make you wanna stay
Theres gotta be a way
Cause going on without you is killing me everyday

And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I cant go another day without you
Would it make you make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you
Would it make you make you wanna stay
I cant go another day without you
Would it make you make you wanna stay
Well Daisy Duke peekaboo
I mightve learned a thing or two
On a Friday night joy ride
Out there on the county line
Drag racing til the blue lights chase us
And we scatter like sparks from a Black Cat fuse
Train bridge where we spraypaint Skynard
And the gold flakes glimmer in the cinnamon booze

We were living every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were running all the caution lights
We were learning to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was something to burn we were burning it
Anything with a curve we were turning it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin heat of the summer

Alabama on the alpine
Bust a cap on a deer sign
A little back seat butterfly
Homegrown angel thatll get you high

We were living every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were running all the caution lights
We were learning to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was something to burn we were burning it
Anything with a curve we were turning it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin heat of the summer

Yeah I see it clearer in the rear view mirror
Then I ever did looking out over the hood
Yeah man we had some damn good times
And I sure hope everybodys doing good

We were living every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were running all the caution lights
We were learning to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was something to burn we were burning it
Anything with a curve we were turning it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin heat of the summer

The hell raisin heat of the summer
The hell raisin heat of the summer
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

Yeah when I first saw that bikini top on her
Shes popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought Oh good lord she had them long tanned legs
Couldnt help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up lets go get this thing stuck

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right her and I man we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell I cant get you out of my head

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yeah
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip
Dont stop girl you know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on shine on
Baby get your shine on
Silverado candy painted
RayBans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here
And get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on shine on
Baby get your shine on
Homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip

Riding high roll up on the down low
Baby get your shine on
Yeah Ive iced down a few thousand beers in my day
To put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it aint hundreds it aint any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends

Once its gone you cant get it back
So lift em up yall where you at

If I could be the reason your hairs a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

And oh all of this talking makes you laugh
But Ive gotta let you know
Just how I feel while im

Looking back at my past
Ive got a bad name but a man can change
Im living proof of that

Till my last day till my last breath
Of everyone that can I can love you the best
Till my last day Ill be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day Ill be loving you

Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull have a beer or two
But you know Ill be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest
Dont ever doubt that Ill be around
And baby dont you ever forget

Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle
But in a place like this you like to raise a little hell

Ive always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy
Corona cold in your hand your brushed back hair
I took another sip of whiskey
And I didnt let the ice cubes melt in the bottom of my plastic cup
And I said hey pretty girl you want to get out of here
And you looked up
Looking in your big blue eyes
Laying there that night

I said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good baby lets be bad
I feel your heart I feel you there
I feel a little brave I feel a little scared tonight
But it sure feels right

Well the sunrise hit the window
And there you were
In my Alabama tshirt
I fly where angels sleep like a dream
You got me thinking bout those  words
And I didnt sneak off like I done so many times before
And you opened up your eyes and gave me a kiss
I said give me one more
And in those twisted covers
We were more than lovers

And it sure feels right 

Live big wide when we go out tonight
And relive that time
Corona cold in your hand your brushed back hair
Ill sip on my whiskey
You know I always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy

Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah I bet shes still crying on that front porch
Yeah this time its gonna take some time to heal

Cause Im on my way to Tennessee
Singing Georgia On My Mind
Chasing what they says a dream
Thinking maybe it aint mine
Cause that girls in every song I sing
Shes in every song I write
And that six string ridin in her seat
Wont keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
Theres more than miles in my rear view

Well Im headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just cant seem to keep myself from wondering
Why Im jealous of all them headlights headed south

Cause Im on my way to Tennessee
Singing Georgia On My Mind
Chasing what they says a dream
Thinking maybe it aint mine
Cause that girls in every song I sing
Shes in every song I write
And that six string ridin in her seat
Wont keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
Theres more than miles in my rear view

Yeah more than miles
Yeah Ive been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her

So Im turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I cant put my dreams before her
Man I need her with me
Cause that girls in every song I sing
Shes in every song I write
And that six string ridin in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what Im supposed to do yeah
Theres still more than miles in my rear view

More than miles yeah
More than miles
I am insensitive I have a tendency to pay more attention to the things that
I need
Sometimes I drink to much sometimes I test your trust sometimes I dunno
Why youre staying with me
Im hard to love hard to love I dont make it easy I couldnt do it if I
Stood where you stood
Im hard to love hard to love you say that you need me I dont deserve
It but I love that you love me goood
I am a short fuse I am a wrecking ball crashing into your heart like I do
Youre like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus I wish that I
Could be more like you
Im hard to love hard to love I dont make it easy I couldnt do it if I
Stood where you stood
Im hard to love hard to love you say that you need me I dont deserve
It but I love that you love me Goood
Love me good
Girl youve given me a million second chances and I dont ever wanna take
You for granted Im just a man Im just a man
Hard to love hard to love oh I dont make it easy and I couldnt do it if
I stood where you stood
Im hard to love hard to love and you say that you need me I dont
Deserve it but I love that you love me good x
You love me good
We didnt care if people stared
Wed make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebodyd tell us to get a room
Its hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that were okay
But I dont want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long bet you forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldnt get enough
Remind me remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldnt stop
And I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be
Wed turn out the lights and we didnt just sleep
Remind me baby remind me
Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Dont just assume I know
Oh baby remind me
Remind me
Do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldnt control ourselves
Remind me yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me oh baby remind me
Yeah youd wake up in my old tshirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me
Baby remind me yeah oh
Yeah youd wake up in my old tshirt
Baby remind me
I know i gotta put in the hours
Make the money while the sunlight shines
But anything i gotta get done
It can get done some other time

Time is love gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
Shes where i need to be
Time is love gotta run

I only get so many minutes
Dont wanna spend em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking
How many kisses have i lost

Time is love gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
Shes where i need to be
Time is love gotta run

Gotta fly
Fly
Before one more moment
Gets by

Time is love gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
Shes where i need to be

Time is love gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
Shes where i need to be
Time is love gotta run
Time is love gotta run
I was Ringo Starr of the dashboard drummers
You were turning up the radio
Sitting in the middle playing the fiddle
You were hotter than a summer back road
And its crazy how I remember that perfectly

When we set sail away in a white Chevrolet
With a Jerry Jet sticker on the glass
We cut through the night like the KC lights
Knowing summertime wasnt gonna last
And we swore that wouldnt matter
And wed stay like that together
But were not cause were not nineteen forever

I remember the time you asked me for a ride
If I could teach you how to drive stick
You burned through the clutch and I burned to the touch
Every tan line wrapping your skin
And I still see every memory

When we set sail away in a white Chevrolet
With a Jerry Jet sticker on the glass
We cut through the night like the KC lights
Knowing summertime wasnt gonna last
And we swore that wouldnt matter
And wed stay like that together
But were not no were not nineteen forever

And I still sing along
With all those old songs
Well I know its wrong I know its wrong
I know its wrong
I gotta move on

When we set sail away in a white Chevrolet
With a Jerry Jet sticker on the glass
We cut through the night like the KC lights
Knowing summertime wasnt gonna last
And we swore that wouldnt matter
And wed stay like that together
But were not no were not nineteen forever
Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town hey wouldnt you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico oh
Now youre walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well theres a move or two Id like to show you
While I still got the chance

Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

Oh oh why wouldnt I wanna stay
Oh oh and let that plane fly away hey hey

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what Im saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
Were falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music
My motorcycle needs an oil change
Fence needs mending house needs paint
I got a million things that need to be done but
Baby I can only focus on one
The way youre looking back at me right now
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre playing with my mind baby aint no doubt
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Baby youve always had a one track mind
So what youre saying aint no surprise
What may come as a shock to you
Is that Im having all those little thoughts too yea
The way youre looking back at me right now
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre playing with my mind baby aint no doubt
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Baby since you and me are on the same page
Lets do something bout it what do you say ay
The way youre looking back at me right now
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre playing with my mind baby aint no doubt
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
The way youre looking back at me right now
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre playing with my mind baby aint no doubt
Im thinking about everything I shouldnt be thinking about
Youre everything I shouldnt be thinking about
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin there on that lawn
Discount shades store bought tan
Flip flops and cutoff jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
Im on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And were were just getting started
I was singin to you you were singin to me
I was so alive never been more free
Fired up my daddys lighter and we sang
Ooohh
Stayed there til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin dont go
When I think about you I think about 
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldnt even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet thered still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didnt care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though youre a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me do you think about 
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woah Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Here we go
Uh ha ha
Yeah
I dont wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow nothing on the radio
I dont wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Things you gotta do places that you gotta go
Oh no
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night
We can rock together let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup make a memory drink it up
I dont wanna miss another minute wanna live it with you
Neath the blue sky falling in love
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night

I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket cause you just got paid babe
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight

Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night

Looks like your cups empty
And youre all alone
I got the good stuff with me
Can you hear that song
It just came on girl
I can tell that youre feeling it
I see the words running off your lips
Aint it crazy cool
Same night same spot
Dont it look like weve got some good timing

Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yeah
No I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy We got
Good timing

Look up at that sky girl
Its a full moon night
You just broke up with somebody
And baby so did I
Just the other night girl
Can you believe what time it is
 lets make a wish
Were going to have a night well never forget
And it aint over yet
Girl we got some good timing

Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yeah
No I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy We got
Good timing

It used to be the only luck I had
Was a day late dollar short always bad
And then I saw your face and it all changed up
Baby just like that
Its alright
Right on the money on the spot
Girl we got some good timing

Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yeah
No I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy We got
Good timing
Good timing
It used to be the only luck I had
Was a day late dollar short always bad
Good timing
And then I saw your face and it all changed up
Baby just like that
Its alright
I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow itd be good for me
I want a cool chick thatll cook for me
Butll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And shell do it with me

I dont need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh I know
That I dont need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na

Now I dont need a garage full of cars
But Ill take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And Ill smoke em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Dont need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol room
Still feels lonely when its just you
Yes it does

I dont need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh I know
That I dont need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na

A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So when I kick back basking in it
Ill be okay with what Ive done
Still having fun

I dont need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh I know
That I dont need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na na na na na
Rivers strong you cant swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moons so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summers what the whole years all about

You look fine fine fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say say say
Hasnt it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

Dont get up just to
Get another you can
Drink from mine we cant
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear youre right
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see

Im a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now Im right here and Im right now
And Im hoping knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

Well Im no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesnt mean I didnt make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest honest
And it hurts to be real
But its nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be

Im a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now Im right here and Im right now
And Im hoping knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Im a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now Im right here and Im right now
And Im hoping knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
It dont matter what plans I got I can break em
Yeah I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I dont mind telling all the guys I cant meet em
Hell we can all go raise some hell any other night

I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin outta moonlight

Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear

Whoa girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa oh heaven let your light shine down

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin on my side

Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin outta moonlight

Whoa girl every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa this is one that we dont wanna miss no

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin on my side

I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin outta moonlight

All I wanna do is hold you tight
Come on come on come on were runnin outta moonlight

Whoa
Ive been broken torn and scattered
Ive loved holy Ive loved sin
I was rolling on the wind
It didnt matter
I was so sure of who I didnt want to be
Every smile and every fear
Every laugh and every tear
It was all mine it was all me
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that Im gonna be
I dont even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces
Weve all been lied to
Weve all been liars
Nothings perfect in this world
Everybodys been burned by the fire
Guess Im learning
That what breaks you makes you grow
But Im not hiding where Ive been
Gonna let the light shine in
What I dont need
Gonna let that let that let that go
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that Im gonna be
I dont even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces
Pieces the good and the bad
Pieces the happy and sad
Pieces the wrong and the right
Pieces thats my thats my thats my life
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that Im gonna be
I dont even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am

Well Im crazy about fast cars football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
Im crazy about Friday nights cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake

But Im ten times crazier without about your love girl
Id do about anything you ask me to
Im just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But Im ten times crazier about you

Well Im all about a weekend kicking with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But dont you go thinking that I wont leave them hanging
Cause even though Im crazy about them good old boys

Im ten times crazier about your loving girl
Id do about anything you ask me to
Im just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But Im ten times crazier about you

I know you love me girl thats easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me

Im ten times crazier about your loving girl
Id do about anything you ask me to
Im just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But Im ten times crazier about you
Im ten times crazier about your loving girl
Id do about anything you ask me to
Im just plain crazy about a lot of things baby

Zoey Dollaz Blow a Check
Ive been thinking bout you all day baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
Its supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like Im going to have to hold you tight yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope its gonna be a long one
And if were lucky its moving slow
I wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Lets go

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train
About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train

She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shouldve never let her go
I shouldve begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah the one that got away

Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the starsoaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shouldve never let her go
I shouldve begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah the one that got away

Every summer that rolls around
Im looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shouldve never let her go
I shouldve begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah the one that got away

Yeah she was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shouldve never let her go
I shouldve begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away
She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Lets turn it up loud mix it up strong
Lean it back slow get your feel good on
Cut em off short roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the partys at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And dont look back cause

Heres to the good times heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time

Well lay it all out spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
Park it way back fog it on up
Singing oh oh
Radio spilling from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hanging on a branch by the river
Thats a memory thatll get you when you look back

Heres to the good times heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time

Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the partys at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And dont look back cause

Heres to the good times heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time
All we do right is make love
And we both know now that aint enough

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Aint gotta ask you whats wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin dress
Lets do what we do best
I guess everybodys got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didnt work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Aint gotta ask you whats wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin dress
Lets do what we do best
I guess everybodys got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Aint gotta ask you whats wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin dress
Lets do what we do best

Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Lets kiss tomorrow goodbye
Cottonwood fallin like snow in July
Sunset riverside four wheel drivesiIn a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
Youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz Im ever gonna find
Hey Im a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you aint a  youre a 
Tippin n spillin that homemade wine
On your tied up Tshirt
Every little kiss is drivin me wild
Throwin little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
Youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz Im ever gonna find
Hey Im a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Lets slip on out where its a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
Well take it off on out in the water

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
Youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz Im ever gonna find
Hey Im a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Yeah Im a little drunk on you
Its bout that time a year again
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumping
Little hiphop something
I was stirring up a coke and crown
Didnt even check in the room
We went straight for the beach
Didnt even give the ice a chance to melt
Now Im scouting my spot
Where we were going to rock
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

Now Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
Who
Hey there cutie with a Kentucky coozie
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy
And why dont you and your friends
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois

Yea Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand

I got to buddy who blew all his money
And he had to stay his brokeass home
Hes been going crazy blowing up my phone
Wanting to know whats going on

I tell him Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

And they keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea Im sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
Yeah

Sitting pretty right here in Suntan City
Girl Ill be over there
With my buddies drinking beer
If you need me come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When youre ready shoot me that smile
That way Ill know that its time to go
You got your buzz on

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets take another shot drink another round
Hug on one another talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothing like love in a college town

All the rumors fly
Did you hear who hooked up last night
Thought she was all about cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
Theres old whatshisname
He just cant seem to graduate
Hitting on the new crop buying them lemon drops
Man thats just wrong

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets take another shot drink another round
Hug on one another talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town

Im going to fail this test
Thinking bout your dress
Laying on my floor
Running out the door
AABAC that sounds good to me

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets give it one more shot
Baby hows that sound
Hug on one another kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town

Got to love love in a college town
Baby what are we becoming
It feels just like were always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I dont even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love Am I still enough
Tell me dont I Or tell me do I baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby do I

Remember when we didnt have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving
Baby those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now Im second guessing everything I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love Am I still enough
Tell me dont I Or tell me do I baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life

Baby do I still give you what you need
Still take your breath away
Light up the spark way down deep
Baby do I

Whoa Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love Am I still enough
Tell me dont I Or tell me do I baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Tell me baby do I get one more try Do I
Baby do I
Girl I been thinking bout us
And you know I aint good at this stuff
These feelings piling up wont give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways yeah maybe
I dont know how long itll take me but Ill do my best

Youll be my soft and sweet
Ill be your strong and steady
Youll be my glass of wine
Ill be your shot of whiskey
Youll be my sunny day
Ill be your shade tree
Youll be my honeysuckle
Ill be your honey bee

Yeah that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I arent done
Theres more where that came from
Well you know Im just having fun but seriously

If youll be my Louisiana
Ill be your Mississippi
Youll be my Little Loretta
Ill be your Conway Twitty
Youll be my sugar baby
Ill be your sweet iced tea
Youll be my honeysuckle
Ill be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all
Im glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each others arms
I could have said I love you
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby all I know to do is speak right from the heart

Youll be my soft and sweet
Ill be your strong and steady
Youll be my glass of wine
Ill be your shot of whiskey
Youll be my sunny day
Ill be your shade tree
Youll be my honeysuckle
Ill be your honey bee

If youll be my Louisiana
Ill be your Mississippi
Youll be my Little Loretta
Ill be your Conway Twitty
Youll be my sugar baby
Ill be your sweet iced tea
Youll be my honeysuckle
Ill be your honey bee

Ill be your honey bee
Hey girl hey where you going
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be heading home so early now
You say you got to work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl I think you and I should just

Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmos getting low
While were trying to figure out
The next place we should go

We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

This place is closing down
But I dont want to quit
Got to good thing going girl
Lets find out what it is

And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like were doing something right
Lets find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

Might make a memory that we wont forget

So lets just drink on it
Yeah
Mm
Drink on it
Sleep on it
We can just drink on it

Theres still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pickups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint you can still see
Allie will you marry me

Take a ride look around
There aint no doubt

It sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town

Theres still a rope burn on that old branch that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There aint a corner of this hallow ground
That we dont laughed or cried on
Its where we loved lived and learned real life stuff
Its everything were made of

It sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

Everywhere there we are
It hits me right in my heart

It sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And well always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town
Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said she said
Aint it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something yall dont know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
Im tired of talking man yall aint listening
Them old dirt roads is what yall missing

Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if its broke round here we fix it
I can take yall where ya need to go
Down to my hood back in them woods

We do it different round here thats right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
Well raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires
Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires
Thats right
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirtythousand feet above could be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Whod want to live down there in the middle of nowhere

Theyve never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
Theyd understand why God made
Those flyover states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineers seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolored painted sky
Youll think heavens doors have opened
Youll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
Youll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
Yeah

Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride
I dont see you laugh
You dont call me back
But you kiss me when youre drunk
I dont know your friends
Dont know where youve been
Why are you the one I want

Dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay
Dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay
Dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me
I cant be alone with you
Youve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I cant be alone with you

Please dont chain that door
I cant win this war
Your bodys like a pill I shouldnt take

Dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay
Dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay
Dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me
I cant be alone with you
Youve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I cant be alone with you
Dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay
Dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay
Dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me
I cant be alone with you
Youve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I cant be alone with you

I dont see you laugh
You dont call me back
But you kiss me when youre drunk
Shes getting dressed up putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shakeing right into them cutoffs baby oh yeah
Youre getting off work cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now lookin so fine
Youve been waiting on this night for such a long long time

She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now youre half way to heaven
She picks a song you turn it up to 
You say Do you wanna and she says Hell yeah
So you hit the party all your buddies are jealous
Someday youll be looking back on your life
At the memories this is gonna be one of those nights

Crowded backyard everybodys laughin
Kinda party next week youll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for  minutes or so and then she whispers Baby lets go

And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off till you turn on the headlights
Someday when youre looking back on your life
At the memories this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah one of those nights

Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and youll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No you never will
Cause someday when youre looking back on your life
At the memories this is gonna be one of those nights

Yeah one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah one of those nights
One of those nights oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh oh
I make you laugh and tell you things
You start thinking this is more than what it really is
Youre beginning to dream and maybe someday
You could be the angel that could make me change
But all I see is the storm that youll get lost in
Cause if it feels this good when we are just talking

You should be walking away walking away
As far as you can go as fast as you can
You dont know it but you ought to be walking away walking away
From me baby
Instead of trying to save me
You ought to be walking away

Youre standing there in your party dress
And there aint no doubt about it darling Im impressed
But I see you and I know me
I would say right now that Im the last thing that you need
But girl dont get me wrong I would sure love to do this
But somewhere in my heart I know the truth is

You ought to be walking away walking away
As far as you can go as fast as you can
You dont know it but you ought to be walking away walking away
From me baby
Instead of trying to save me
You ought to be walking away
You should be walking away walking away
As far as you can go fast as you can
You dont know it but you ought to be walking away walking away
From me baby
Instead of trying to save me
You ought to be walking away
She was sittin all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin by a Georgia plate
I was lookin for her boyfriend
Thinkin no way she aint got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin in love
Tryin to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Id gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin like a fool AM FM XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man you should have seen her light up

She was like oh my God this is my song
Weve been listenin to the radio all night long
I cant believe that it came back on but here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

And she said play it again play it again play it again
The next Friday night we were sittin out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Yeah play it again play it again play it again
Somebody play it again play it again play it again
Home is where my heart is still beating
I dont know when Ill see her again
I hate to see her cry when Im leaving
But now Im a thousand miles away again
She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back Im behind her
Ill always be there for her
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
She feels like Carolina
Its hard to understand the way Im living
I know she thinks Im never coming home never coming home
But I miss her pretty smile and Im coming back in a little while
But Im a thousand miles away again
She feels like Carolina feels like Carolina
Looks like California looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back Im behind her
Ill always be there for her
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
No matter how far I go you know I cant stop thinking about her
And theres nothing like the way I feel the way I feel when Im beside her
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
She feels like Carolina feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back Im behind her feels like Carolina
Ill always be there for her
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
Carolina
California
Like homes not so far away
She feels like Carolina feels like Carolina
Looks like California
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
She makes me feel like home so far away
She makes me feel like homes not so far away
Verse 
I turn the TV off to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself anything to make a sound
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Verse 
You can say were done the way you always do
Its easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends you know theyre gonna say
Were bad for each other but we aint good for anyone else
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Bridge
We dont have to miss each other come over
We dont have to fix each other come over
We dont have to say forever come over
You dont have to stay forever come over
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Outro
Come over come over come over come over come over
Come over come over come over come over come over

We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
Thats when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man aint this some shhhh

Your daddys gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldnt change one thing
Baby yeah I know it sounds crazy

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man they werent playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk em
They didnt fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didnt smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

I swear your daddys gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldnt change one thing
Baby yeah I know it sounds crazy

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh and you were like

Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didnt mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didnt mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Songwriter  Sam Hunt
It was our first week
At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It was 
Nothin to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in

We were summertime sippin sippin
Sweet tea kissin off of your lips
Tshirt drippin drippin wet
How could I forget

Watchin that blonde hair swing
To every song Id sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
 you and me
You and me

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up so in love
So lets just stay right here

Til the sun starts creepin creepin up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin thinkin of
When I looked at you

Watchin that blonde hair swing
To every song Id sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
 you and me
You and me

Watchin that blonde hair swing
To every song Id sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful beautiful

That blonde hair swing
To every song Id sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
 you and me
First week in myrtle beach where it all began
I got a little drunk last night
Theres something bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldnt get you off my brain
I guess I wasnt thinking straight
I couldnt tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

Brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
Its off my chest but never off my mind
Two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear its the last time every time
Dont know why

Mightve been a song on the radio
Mightve been nothing baby I dont know
Mightve been a little too tired to fight
Mightve been I got a little drunk last night

I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I dont remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

Brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
Its off my chest but never off my mind
Two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear its the last time every time
Dont know why

Mightve been a song on the radio
Mightve been nothing baby I dont know
Mightve been a girl that looked like you
Mightve been a fluke mightve been a full moon
Mightve been a little too tired to fight
Mightve been I got a little drunk last night

Mightve been a song on the radio
Mightve been nothing baby I dont know
Mightve been a girl that looked like you
Mightve been a fluke mightve been a full moon
Mightve been a little too tired to fight
Mightve been I got a little drunk

Brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
Its off my chest but never off my mind
Two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear its the last time every time

I got a little drunk last night
I got a little drunk last night
Thought I could keep it all inside
But I got a little drunk last night
Hammer and a nail stacking them bales
Im dog tired by the  hour
But Im ready to raise some hell
And Jesses getting ready Im gassing up the Chevy
Im gonna pick her up at six
I hope shes gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off sip a little pass it around
Dance in the dust turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
Its a feelin alright Saturday night
And thats how we do it round here
Yeah thats how we do it round here

Mud on the grips wild cherry on her lips
Ive been working and trying and flirting and dying
For an all night kinda kiss
Country on the boombox candles on the tool box
Im doing everything right got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight
Yeah the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off sip a little pass it around
Dance in the dust turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
Its a feelin alright Saturday night
And thats how we do it round here
Yeah thats how we do it round here

Yeah thats how we do it round here
Yeah thats how we do it round here
In a nothing to do town nothings going down
After them stars show up
Its all dinners and TVs red lights blinking
Then everybodys sleeping but us
Now what do you do when youre young and in love
And you got a new set of keys
And a beautiful girl with a bedroom window
Next to an old oak tree

Nothing good happens before midnight
I get all caught up kissing on you in the radio lights
No ones watching but these blue eyes
Aint no close enough
Getting all kinda wrong feeling all kinda right
Nothing good happens before midnight

It was killing the headlights rolling in neutral
So they couldnt hear us drive off
It was king of the main street queen of the bench seat
Just us from dusk til dawn
Found a little spot in the dark by the water
Where we could lose track of time
The days were a parttime grocery store
But the nights were your lips on mine

Nothing good happens before midnight
I get all caught up kissing on you in the radio lights
No ones watching but these blue eyes
Aint no close enough
Getting all kinda wrong feeling all kinda right
Nothing good happens before midnight

Racing that sun back to your house
Wishing it would hurry up and go back down
So we can do it all again

Nothing good happens before midnight
I get all caught up kissing on you in the radio lights
No ones watching but these blue eyes
Aint no close enough
Getting all kinda wrong feeling all kinda right
Nothing good happens before midnight
Well me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up and said Whatll it be
I said The good stuff

He didnt reach around for the whiskey
He didnt pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said You cant find that here

Because its the first long kiss on a second date
Mommas all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And its the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah man thats the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said Ill have some of that
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said Thats my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed

He said Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But Ive been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl
Married his high school love
And its a new teeshirt saying Im a Grandpa
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah man thats the good stuff

He said When you get home shell start to cry
When she says Im sorry say So am I
And look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
Because thats the good stuff
Thats the good stuff
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldnt do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

Yeah we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher
Yeah life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know Im a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor a lawyer a senators son
Brad Pitts brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that Im still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night
Damn pretty girl you went and done it again

I didnt tell a soul
Where I was gonna be
I just let em know
Id be gone about a week
The snows been comin down for days
The roads are closed but thats okay
Cause Im lost in Caroline
In the warmth of every whisper
In the fire in her eyes
While the cold wind blows outside
I found what Ive been needin
In this cabin in the Colorado pines
Yeah Im lost in Caroline
With this mountain draped in gray
There aint much of a view
And this weathers bound to break
In a day or two
If I see a sun come out
Ill just pull the shades on down
Cause Im lost in Caroline
In the warmth of every whisper
In the fire in her eyes
While the cold wind blows outside
I found what Ive been needin
In this cabin in the Colorado pines
Yeah Im lost in Caroline
While the cold wind blows outside
I found what Ive been needin
In this cabin in the Colorado pines
Yeah Im lost in Caroline
Im so lost in Caroline
Girl you and me aint talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There arent nothing left for us I think enoughs enough
I look down see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
Weve been living like this too long
And there aint no reason to turn around baby you can have it all

I aint I aint coming back
Ive already been there done that
And Im done with you messing with my mind
The last times the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love aint never been enough
So I arent coming back
Ive been there done that

Street by street and town after little town
Feels like Im on the right road now
I bet youre probably wondering how I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know Ive done everything I should
To try to make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see
We werent meant to be

I aint I aint coming back
Ive already been there done that
And Im done with you messing with my mind
The last times the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love aint never been enough
So I aint coming back
Ive been there done that

Ill wake up and Ill start to second guess myself
And Ill crave your touch oh but I know too well

That I aint I aint coming back
Ive already been there done that
And Im done with you messing with my mind
The last times the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love aint never been enough
So I aint coming back
No I aint coming back
Ive been there done that

Cause

Meanwhile back at Mamas
The porch lights on come on in if you wanna
Suppers on the stove and beers in the fridge
Red sun sinkin out low on the ridge
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought youd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
Its time we head on back

Cause meanwhile back at Mamas
The for sale signs goin up and Im gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a threeacre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin for broke and were gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

Me and you back at Mamas
Yeah me and you back at Mamas
I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss
Baby taste the moonshinin off of your lips
I want to see that want ya smile
Still got me hooked been hooked for awhile
If you got a bottle you aint opened yet
And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed
If you got some room for a little regret
Let me know girl Ive already left

If youre feelin what Im feelin lets mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I hope you get lonely tonight
We aint gotta make up just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You aint gotta wake up and miss me no
I hope you get lonely tonight

I dont care if youre spinnin in the neon
Or burnin up the sheets with my tee on
Either way the thought is turning me on
And I cant shake it girl Im wide awake so

If youre feelin what Im feelin lets mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I hope you get lonely tonight
We aint gotta make up just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You aint gotta wake up and miss me no
I hope you get lonely tonight

Hope you get lonely
Hope you get lonely
Hope you get lonely tonight
Girl

If youre feelin what Im feelin lets mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I hope you get lonely tonight
We aint gotta make up just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You aint gotta wake up and miss me no
I hope you get lonely tonight

Lonely tonight
Lonely tonight
Yep girl I hope you get lonely tonight
I catch myself wishing
You were whispering my name
Every star every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away
I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream every scene
Every song wed ever sing
Got lost in yesterday

Ive been trying to do without you
But I cant give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

Do you find yourself wondering
If I still think about you
Every thought every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah thats all I ever do

Ive been trying to do without you
But I cant give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright

But I cant give up this fight
Everything will be alright

That water towers got the sun going down behind it
If theres a good time in this town girl were gonna find it
You looked so damn good climbing up in my Chevy
Tried to play it cool but I knew already
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights
It was gonna be one of those nights

Got the kenwoods banging that rock n roll
Whisper to me baby where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
I love the way you lean that seat back steal my ballcap
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I cant wait to see where it goes

We can run the reds down Main Street dodging the blue lights
Or disappear off into the corn out past the county line
Baby keep on keep on swaying to the backbeat
Long as youre right here right here beside me
You make the call baby I dont care
We can take this anywhere

Whisper to me baby where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I cant wait to see where it goes

Whisper to me baby where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I cant wait to see where it goes

And I cant wait to see where it goes
I cant wait to see where it goes oh yeah
Just letting the night roll
Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The nights still young never going to get old
Living for today like theres no tomorrow
Follow the grooves the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like were never coming back

Its a Friday night its a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
 twelves in the truck back beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing whoa whoa everything whoa whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are we are we are tonight

Swaying backnforth cant you feel the music
Time stands still I dont want to lose it
Her tan her touch her laugh
Were flying so high like were never gonna crash

Its a Friday night its a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
 twelves in the truck back beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing whoa whoa everything whoa whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are we are we are tonight

We are tonight we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and were so alive tonight

Its a Friday night its a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
 twelves in the truck back beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing whoa whoa everything whoa whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are we are we are tonight

We are tonight
Everything we want to be yeah
We are we are we are tonight
Yeah
We are tonight
Whoa oh oh oh oh

Baby put the beer down ice cold
Leave it on the mantle lets roll
I aint gonna lie youre looking good in the chandelier light
But I wanna see you out there in the moonshine
Like a diamond in a bale of hay
Strike it like a match startin us a flame
Take my hand and well disappear
But they wont even know we aint here
Lets slide on out put it in drive
Find a little spot where we can hide
Down by the river make a few waves
And baby if it starts to rain
We can have a party up in my cab
Crack that moon roof kick the seats back
And maybe baby you can meet me in the middle for a little kiss
Yea tonight were gonna do it like this
Yea tonight were gonna do it like this
I want you and me like right now
When I hit the headlights and duck out
Were gonna fly like lightning through the night
Yea and about the time they realize
Well be parked with the engine running
Aint nobody gonna see us coming
When they all wake up in the morning
Theyll be talking theyll be wandering
How the two of us got away with it
Yea do it like this
Girl hop in
Roll down the window
Well find us some good country radio
Drive down a dirt road till it ends
Put your feet up on the dashboard
Thats what that thing was made for
Lean over and give me a big ol kiss
I swear the way you do it
Your love is like country music

So come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i cant get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back listen to it
Your love is like country music
Woah oh woah oh
Yeah yeah

Lets stop here
Drink in the moonlight
Get out there and dance in the head lights
You can hold on to me all night long
I want to feel your warmth by the sway
To every tune the dj is playing
Somebody oughta put you in a song
I swear the way you do it
Your love is like country music

So come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i cant get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back listen to it
Your love is like country music
Oh yeah

I can get lost here in your arms
Carried away on a steel guitar
Like a song stuck in my heart
Playing on and on and on

Come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i cant get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back listen to it
Your love is like country music
Woah oh woah oh
Yeah yeah
Woah oh girl I love when you do it
Woah oh woah oh
Yeah yeah
I park the car out on the beach let the water kiss my feet
Can hear the music coming from the pier
The beat is fast the bass is loud
I could disappear into the crowd
But I think that Ill just stay out here
Cause since youre gone

I cant hear another feel good summer song
The sunshine only lights up what is wrong
I should just give in and sing along and laugh like we used to
The tide is high the sky is blue but how can I get over you
When every station is playing a feel good summer song

It seems like you were just right here
The sand was white the coast was clear
You kissed me just so you could steal my shades
We snick off underneath the dock
As the waves crashed on the rocks
You told me that youd always feel this way
But now youre gone


Since youre gone the musics trying to sway me to move on
But I just want to stay here all night long missing you
Wishing you would come back but youre gone
Im meetin my buddies out on the lake
Were headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
Theres no signin up no monthly dues
Take your Johnson your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the waters fine
Just idle on over an toss us a line

Basstrackers Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin trailer park
Anchored out and gettin loud all summer long
Side by side theres five houseboat front porches
Astroturf lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin the boat thats us

Bermudas flipflops and a tanktop tan
He popped his first top at  am thats Bob

Well pull out the jar and that old guitar

Hey girl whatcha think about this got a really good idea

Forty miles off the map we can get there real fast

Kick back move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash girl you know Im cool with that
And its Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight

Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know
Baby let it go baby let it go

I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at  am
Id never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
Ive never been a real night owl
But these days im all turned around
Theres only one thing im sure of right now

I should be sleeping

These late hours ive been keeping
Ive been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though im feeling so right
Im so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

I never knew that i was funny
til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like ill be up for a while


After just three dates
And one great kiss
Its way too soon
To be obsessing like this


Dreaming about you

We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldnt make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would
We broke down a time or two
Thought maybe we didnt think it through
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasnt lookin good
Were lookin back laughin
cause they called us crazy
chorus
We were young we were wild we were restless
We were livin for the minute we were spinnin in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
Look at us goin strong
Lookin back laughin
cause they called us crazy
repeat chorus
Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But thatd been crazy
We were young we were wild we were restless
Had to go had to fly had to get away
Took a chance on that feeling
We were lovin blind borderline reckless
We were livin for the minute we were spinning in
Maybe we were a lot of things
Oh maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
We werent crazy
We werent crazy

Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rear view
But dust nothing but dust

Of the only life shes ever known
But theres a future thats bright in the dead of this night
And all shes gotta do is go

Ignition

She walked up said she needed a drink
I said whatcha want she said whatcha think
I took a sip and we were slipping away
To a little corner table to the left of the stage
It was just some random night in July
No there wasnt no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing we were just having fun
Next thing you know

Three two one We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up couldnt stop it Woah woah
When she talked I just wanted to listen
Just like that we were kissin
Whenever I get to reminiscin
I think about how it started out
As a whats up catch a buzz
Talkin bout whatever ended up being the best night ever

We were there till they closed down the bar
Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watched the stars fade out my head on your shoulder
Saying baby please dont let it be over
Ive been everywhere all over this town tryin to recreate it
But I never found whatever it was whatever we had
No nothing no nothings gonna ever top that

We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up couldnt stop it Woah woah
When she talked I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin
Whenever I get to reminiscin
I think about how it started out
As a whats up catch a buzz
Talkin bout whatever ended up being the best night ever

Wasnt even trying to fall in love
But just like that 

We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up couldnt stop it Woah woah
When she talked I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin
Whenever I get to reminiscin
I think about how it started out
As a whats up catch a buzz
Talkin bout whatever ended up being
The best night
Whats up catch a buzz
Talkin bout whatever ended up being
The best night ever

Woah best night ever

Tell em all Im on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you aint heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where Ive been
Tell em Im out on the West Coast
Where it dont ever rain
And that Im probably doing fine

Just dont tell em Ive gone crazy
That Im still strung out over you
Tell em anything you want to
Just dont tell em all the truth
Yeah dont tell em all the truth

Tell em all Im out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell em that I must be into something bad for me
Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell em Im out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can

Just dont tell em Ive gone crazy
That Im still strung out over you
Tell em anything you want to
Just dont tell em all the truth
Yeah dont tell em all the truth

The truth is that Im asking you to lie
And we both know that it aint right

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Tell em anything you want to
Just dont tell em all the truth
Yeah dont tell em all the truth
I still need you

Yeah thats the truth
I still love you
Baby thats the truth
In the little bitty towns between map dots
We dont tailgate in a parking lot
We bump down dirt roads in jacked up trucks
Far from the bars and smoky night clubs
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We got a hundred blue cans
Sitting on ice in the back of my truck
And George Strait blaring in a Chevrolet
We open up the doors wide and let it play
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
This ol truck hood makes a pretty good seat
Got my feet on the bumper sipping on a drink
And not too long well take it down to the creek
The ice cold water will set you free
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We got a hundred blue cans
Sitting on ice in the back of my truck
And George Strait blaring in a Chevrolet
We open up the doors wide and let it play
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
Yeah my baby looks good in her little tank top
About two am we go sneaking off
We got a spot beneath a cottonwood tree
And she knows what shes gonna do to me
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We got a hundred blue cans
Sitting on ice in the back of my truck
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We got a hundred blue cans
Sitting on ice in the back of my pickup truck
George Strait blaring in a Chevrolet
We open up the doors wide and let it play
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
Yeah
We do it in a field
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
We do it in a field rocking all night till the sun comes up
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh a sailors sky made a perfect sunset
And thats the day Ill never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart dont forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked I couldnt believe just what I saw
She said I bet you dont remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart dont forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart dont forget no a heart dont forget
I said a heart dont forget something like that
Oh not something like that
We gonna melt some ice
We gonna roll the dice
We gonna slip and slide into paradise
We gonna grind some gears
We gonna ring some ears
We gonna drink some beers
Til they disappear
Turn the party up
Drink the good times down
Little buzz in a cup
Will hit ya get ya space bound
Sip a little whiskey come on baby kiss me
Let me get a drip of your frisky gypsy
And when ya hit ten bump it to eleven
Tonight we gonna fly with them s
Get highhhhhhhhh hiiggghhhhh
Gonna kill another  pack just to watch it die
Turn the party up up up
Turn the party up up up
Hey pretty girl tell me what you think
This country boy pour you a drink
Crank this party up and lets ride
Miles of moonlight by my side
Old dirt roads go straight to heaven
Forget tomorrow tonight were living
Crank this party up to eleven
Forget tomorrow tonight we
Turn the party up
Drink the good times down
Little buzz in a cup
Will hit ya get ya space bound
Sip a little whiskey come on baby kiss me
Let me get a drip of your frisky gypsy
And when ya hit ten bump it to eleven
Tonight we gonna fly with them s
Get highhhhhhhhh hiiggghhhhh
Gonna kill another  pack just to watch it die
Turn the party up up up
Turn the party up up up
Stepped off the plane down in Cabo
Just meaning to stay for a week
I got a funny sensation about this vacation
The second the sand hit my feet
Taxi driver took my two bags
He saw me looking at my watch
He said you wont need that here cause time disappears
In paradise there aint no clocks

You got a lot to learn about living
Its a different world down here
Our biggest problems deciding what fish were frying
Does it go with tequila or beer

He dropped me off at the hotel
I took a uturn into the bar
I sat down on a stool out by the pool
Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
I tried to make a call to LA
Dang thing wouldnt work I started to curse
Bartender said I bet it can wait

You got a lot to learn about living
Its a different world down here
Our biggest problems deciding what fish were frying
Does it go with tequila or beer

I yi yichange is in the air
Now I yi yiaint got a care

Six months later Im driving a taxi
I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie
I say its time to loosen up man

You got a lot to learn about living
Its a different world down here
Our biggest problems deciding what fish were frying
Does it go with tequila or beer
You got a lot to learn about living
Its a different world down here
Our biggest problems deciding what fish were frying
Does it go with tequila or beer
Ive been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl its so wrong
How he dont even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he dont even see
Youre too pretty to be left alone
Sooner or later somebodys gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
Im looking for my end and its all in
While hes just waiting for the night to end
I aint never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you written on my face
I aint gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
Im looking for my end and its all in
While hes just waiting for the night to end
I aint never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me

Its the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
Im looking for my end and its all in
While hes just waiting for the night to end
I aint never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
Come on girl wont you go with me
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin slow
An so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But its July
Im gettin paid by the hour an older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
Id like to call him somethin
I think Ill just call it a day

Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

Oh this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An half the night
Tomorrow mornin I know therell be hell to pay
Hey but thats all right
I aint had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacations gonna start right here
If the phones for me
You can tell em I just sailed away

And pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

I could pay off my tab pour myself in a cab
An be back to work before two
At a moment like this I cant help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do
Funny you should ask Alan Id say
Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
He dont care
I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

What time zone am I on What country am I in
It doesnt matter its five oclock somewhere
Its always on five in Margaritaville come to think of it
Yeah I heard that
You been there havent you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
Ive been to Margaritaville a few times
All right thats good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha between the buoys I tell you
All right Well its five oclock Lets go somewhere
Im ready crank it up
Lets get out of here
Im gone
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And thats home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house its not much to talk about
But its filled with love thats grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love

Its funny how its the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
Theres no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This Ive come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love


I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we dont have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive done seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Well the plane touched down just about three oclock
And the citys still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life Im living in
But the plane brought me farther Im surrounded by water
And Im not going back again

I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah Im leaving GA
And if it werent for tequila and pretty seoritas
Id have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah Im leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They cant believe that I just couldnt leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender shes from the islands
Her bodys been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I dont know if its her or the rum

I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes and all the muchachas they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And Ill grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The seoritas dont careo when theres no dinero
Yeah I got no money to stay

Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

Im just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today life is good today
Well take a look at whats left in that sunset
Fireflies popping like the Fourth of July yeah
Youre gonna wanna see every single thing Im gonna show you tonight
Got the perfect scene set of a moonlight glowing
Just keep them baby blues wide open
Girl take a look around yeah its going down
Its going down just right
Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you dont wanna miss no
Its all getting to what weve been waiting on
Im gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong Im gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Sun gone down nights are getting hotter
Weve got this bed backed up to the water
Yeah its the place to be if you wanna see every little shining star
But that view aint nothing like the you Im lookin at
Two tan legs for days dangling off the back
It all looks better baby you can see forever when youre here in my arms
Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you dont wanna miss no
Its all getting to what weve been waiting on
Im gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong Im gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Just when you thought you had seen it all
Well it turns out you dont have to see it all
Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you dont wanna miss no
Its all getting to what weve been waiting on
Im gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong Im gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Hey pretty girl might wanna close your eyes for this
Close your eyes for this
I hear youre out there now and youre doing alright
A new lease on life in Hollywood
Riding around with the ragtop down
Bet the west coast sun looks good on you
Wasnt very long ago we were sitting
On a lost dirt road by the railroad tracks
If you ever think about that
And wonder where Im at and wanna come back

Im sitting on a tailgate in the middle of a stargaze
Wishing you were in my arms
Chilling right here baby if you want it
Ive got a cold beer with your name on it
Back  on a Friday night
Me and you dancing in the firelight
Girl you gotta admit it sounds pretty good dont it
Ive got a cold beer with your name on it

Pop the top kick back like we used to do
Sipping all night long to your favorite tunes
If you ever get tired of the concrete life
Those honking horns them flashing lights
Got a jar of shine if you need it
Under the seat you know where I keep it
Hey girl turn off your cell phone
Put your blue jeans on get back home


Cooler loaded down picture perfect view
All thats missing now is you


Girl you gotta admit it sounds pretty good dont it
Got a cold beer with your name on it
Theres a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darling pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter dripping off a biscuit baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like its finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair sucking in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
Thats what country is

It aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
Its a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boones farm kiss
It aint a John Deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
Its a Jimmie Rodgers song that was long forgotten
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
Thats what country is

When the sun starts slipping from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
Bout an hour til we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole waving at the riverboats
And when theyre gone take a dip in the moon glow
Thats what country is

It aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
Its a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boones farm kiss
It aint a John Deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
Its a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
Thats what country is

It aint a jacked up truck thats never seen a pasture
Its cars pulling over for a nocab tractor
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No it cant be bought its something youre born with
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
Yeah you got every guy in here
Spinning around spilling their beer
Bet you came out to have a good time
What you say you leave your friends with mine
Oooh ooh yeah theyll be alright
Ooh I just wanna see you shine

Girl youre tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
Thats how I wanna see you girl

Seventeen we owned those streets
Parking lot that was our spot
Thats where wed always meet
And wed roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere USA
Wed light the midnight up

Wed drive too fast
Wed get too loud
We thought we made the world go round
Nothin but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast drink it down
Say yeah man we run this town

All the girls next door
Theyd meet us out there
They couldnt wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before theyd leave
Guess they thought we were cool because

Wed drive too fast
Wed get too loud
Yeah we thought we made the world go round
Drop it down in fourwheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast drink it down
Say yeah man we run this town

From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh we didnt know nothin
But we knew everything

Wed drive too fast
Wed get too loud
We thought we made the world go round
Nothin but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast drink it down
Say yeah man we run this town

High five and look around
Damn right we run this town
Man I love this town
Come on
She was  all about me grew up good on the
Tennessee river and her
Daddy didnt like me much
Yeah that might have been part of the rush
I was  just a son of a gun rolling like a stone I was born to run
But I never met a girl like that
Had me turning round coming right back
We were crazy crazy in love like youve never know
She said baby dont you ever let me go

We were fast car top down
George Straight singing bare feet slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town summertime sunset dreaming
Man there aint nothing like a first time feeling

Wrapped up there in a blanket
Nervous kiss hands were shaking
Yeah we knew we were getting into
There was magic underneath that moon driving me
Crazy more than she could ever know
And I said baby I aint ever gonna let ya go

We were fast car top down
George Straight singing bare feet slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town summertime sunset dreaming
Man there aint nothing like a first time feeling

Oh and the leaves fell down and the seasons changed
And that pretty little thing just moved away to
Texas I guess a part of me did too
Cause I miss her like crazy
She was my baby take me back take me back

We were fast car top down
George Straight singing bare feet slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town summertime sunset dreaming
Man there aint nothing like a first time feeling
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl in your own little world
Let me in it

You got all of my attention
And you aint even trying

Dancing when there aint no music
Just the right kind of crazy baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock n roll tshirt
Were at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing

Theres that flower shop on Main
Lord its been too long since its seen my face
I probably shouldve stopped by yesterday
Just a few miles from our house
Theres a neon sign flashing coldest beer in town
Is she gone for good Well its hard to say
But Im going to be ready either way

I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see
And this six pack might not be enough
But its a damn good start if were ending us
Well either work it out or we wont
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
And a six pack if she dont

Im praying love will bring her back
Oh just one more chance thats all Ill ever ask
I sure hope she aint a memory yet
But she left her book there on the bed
Would a woman leave a man like that

I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see
And this six pack might not be enough
But its a damn good start if were ending us
Well either work it out or we wont
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
And a six pack if she dont

Is she gone for good Well its hard to say
But Im going to be ready either way

I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me baby
Whyd it take so long to see
And this six pack might not be enough
But its a damn good start if were ending us
Well either work it out or we wont
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
Yeah I got these dozen roses in case she comes back home
And a six pack if she dont
And a six pack if she dont
And a six pack if she dont
Must be something in her lipstick
Got me this messed up just off her kiss
Kicked back and Im feeling all right
Parked by the river shes got her
Tan lines hanging out by the water
Better slow down if Im gonna tie one on tonight
Aint even drinkin but Im buzzing baby
Aint even smoking but Im so stoned
Feels like Im getting lit
Aint even took a sip
But Im already gone
Too drunk to drive home
And I aint even drinkin
Dont need no rum or Bacardi
Cause that girl shes my kinda party
Shes the only shot that I need
Sun sinks she starts to get frisky
One touch and Im feeling tipsy
Somebody take my keys
Aint even drinkin but Im buzzing baby
Aint even smoking but Im so stoned
Feels like Im getting lit
Aint even took a sip
But Im already gone
Too drunk to drive home
And I aint even drinkin
Shes got me feelin fine
Higher than a Georgia pine
Stronger than homemade shine
She gets me every time
Aint even drinkin but Im buzzing baby
Aint even smoking but Im so stoned
Feels like Im getting lit
Aint even took a sip
But Im already gone
Too drunk to drive home
And I aint even drinkin
Aint even drinkin
Aint even drinkin
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybodys guess
And I was thinking that I probably didnt stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves walked up and I said
Hey I know I dont know you but Id kinda like a shot
She said I saw you coming over I already thought it over
And okay so now what

And I said well I got a car she said theres something
At least its a start I said its better than nothing
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there aint no way of knowing
I guess I hadnt thought it through that far
But I got a car

So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night when outta nowhere
She said Id give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said I could use a change but I dont even know where to begin

And I said well I got a car she said theres something
At least its a start I said its better than nothing
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there aint no way of knowing
I really hadnt thought it through that far
I cant promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

We got lost in the miles lost track of the days
Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said you know whats on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning rain pouring down
She said I think its time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said what are we gonna do now
And I said well I got a car she said theres something
You think itll start I said its already running
Got your things in the back and Im ready when you are
She said are you sure itll get us where were going
I said if theres one thing I know girl its gotten us this far
And I dont mean to hurry but Im ready when you are
Honey suckle in the air breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high under your still tide
Up in every move you make baby Im your DJ
Youre my favorite song wont you let me sing along

Sittin right here out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear Ive never seen ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back windows down
Im turning it up and youre spinnin around
Takin a sip swingin your hips
Girl youre looking so fine with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum call me the lucky one
Shining these HiBeams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful I got the cooler full

Sittin right here out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear Ive never seen ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back windows down
Im turning it up and youre spinnin around
Takin a sip swingin your hips
Girl youre looking so fine with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

Sittin right here out here in the middle of nowhere nowhere
I swear Ive never seen ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Oh oh oh

I got the key turned back windows down
Im turning it up and youre spinnin around
Takin a sip swingin your hips
Girl youre looking so fine with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
Rollin on up in our off road rider
Sun sinking down stars getting brighter
Fireflies dancing like free fall lighters
Set the mood for a good time nighter
Backwoods boys cant stop watching
Them little hips swaying swaying
Rocking and dropping
Bumping cans spilling tripping slipping and popping
You know us you know we aint stopping

Raise up your cup come on drink it up
Keep the party sparking like the moon stuck
We aint going nowhere
Naw we just crazy kids and we aint got a care
Heres to riding on the high life
A little puff and a hell yeah high five
The memories the laughs the girls the nights
The best friends buzzin on the best beers of our lives
Yeah on the best beers of our lives
A little country jumpin out the radio
A little slow groove pull her in real close

Moon coming through the pines
Cranking up a country song
Heaven right by your side
And a Saturday night barely hanging on
Sun shining through the stained glass
Humming Just As I Am
Im praying that feeling would last
That feeling that saves you
Makes you wanna raise your hands

Thats the way it was
And thats the way it is when youre growing
Up in the mud and the buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where Im gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row

I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads where mama saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls

Thats the way it was
And thats the way it is when youre growing
Up in the mud and the buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where Im gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
It got me where I am and where Im gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
Yeah yeah somewhere out there between the back roads and the back row
Ive always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy
Corona cold in your hand your brushed back hair
I took another sip of whiskey
And I didnt let the ice cubes melt in the bottom of my plastic cup
And I said hey pretty girl you want to get out of here
And you looked up
Looking in your big blue eyes
Laying there that night

I said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good baby lets be bad
I feel your heart I feel you there
I feel a little brave I feel a little scared tonight
But it sure feels right

Well the sunrise hit the window
And there you were
In my Alabama tshirt
I fly where angels sleep like a dream
You got me thinking bout those  words
And I didnt sneak off like I done so many times before
And you opened up your eyes and gave me a kiss
I said give me one more
And in those twisted covers
We were more than lovers

And it sure feels right 

Live big wide when we go out tonight
And relive that time
Corona cold in your hand your brushed back hair
Ill sip on my whiskey
You know I always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy
Where you been hiding all week girl
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar in every place
Somehow I miss your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

Yeah in the morning Ill be gone gone gone
Oh baby thats just wrong wrong wrong

Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week wed had you and me
Being drunk tangled up waking up
No we wouldnt be done
Just getting started
Every night another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Lets make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
Fore we say our goodbyes girl

Yeah in the morning youll be gone gone gone
So baby lets just hold on

Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week wed had you and me
Being drunk tangled up waking up

What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this

Girl we woulda had one hell of a time
If I had met you on night one

Being drunk tangled up

Seven more days of your sweet kiss

 through  runnin wild through the streets with an attitude
Down to Tiger Town Tavern in that old tin roof thinkin we were cool
With fake IDs and on Daddys dime
Yeah we made it to class when we made the time
Oh but usually we had a little more on our minds
Like them tailgates Saturdays and Friday nights
We were young and in love every single week
Learnin more about life than they could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all wed need to get us far
Yeah we were livin like rockstars shuttin down bars
On PBJs and PBRs
That Sigma Chi gig every other Thursday
Wouldnt make a penny but we tried to play
And cover songs for all of them college honeys
Give ol Luke Bryan a run for his money
We were young and in love every single week
Learnin more about life than they could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all wed need to get us far
Yeah we were livin like rockstars shuttin down bars
On PBJs yeah and PBR
Now lookin back on those days I wouldnt change a thing
Yeah we were young and in love every single week
Learnin more about life than they could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all wed need to get us far
And it sure got us far
Young and in love every single week
Learnin more about life than they could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all wed need to get us far
Yeah we were livin like rockstars shuttin down bars
On PBJs and PBRs

One little drink never wrecked no party
Thought we were over baby but you kept getting closer baby
One little touch never broke no heart girl
But I always want to finish what you start girl

Like a bullet and its hard to breath
One little kiss never killed nobody but me

Right here they said I never would have listened when you whispered in my ear
Last night when you said Baby its alright


Nobody but me 
Windows down country sound FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin down some old back road

Now baby dont you look at me that way
Cause you know theres only so much I can take
Cause you make me want to

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over let me hold you close
And tell you everything Im thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol

Windows down country sound FM on the radio
There wasnt nothing as pretty in Panama City as you
Thats what I took away from that spring break that year
And there wasnt no shortcut down to LSU
But it wasnt like it was hard talking me into

Driving all night driving all night
Driving like a bat out of hell
Cheap motels calling my name
No way Im stopping this Chevy
Red Bulls keeping my lead foot heavy

     am
Steve Earle out Tom Petty back in
Bird dog working hard giving them blue lights away hey
Driving all night driving all night driving all night
Just to hold you for a day

Youre a rumrunner kiss that I still get drunk on
Youre a text youre a call that falls out of the blue
Youre a snapshot in my head and on my phone
And you aint got to ask twice Im already gone
Girl Im gone

Driving all night driving all night
Driving like a bat out of hell
Cheap motels calling my name
No way Im stopping this Chevy
Red Bulls keeping my lead foot heavy

     am
Steve Earle out Tom Petty back in
Bird dog working hard giving them blue lights away hey
Driving all night driving all night driving all night
Just to hold you for a day

Girl you aint never too out of the way
All you got to do is say the word and Ill get to you
I keep rocking and rolling right on through

     am
Tom Petty out Steve Earle back in
Bird dog working hard giving them blue lights away hey
Driving all night driving all night driving all night
Just to hold you for a day

You keep me driving all night
Wasnt nothing as pretty in Panama City as you
Me and daddyd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates fixing fence and roads
That is how my story goes

If you want to know the real me just turn the page in my dirt road diary
Its right there for you to see
Every kiss every beer every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round windows down on a summer night
I was there that was me
Its right here in my dirt road diary

I remember when I turned sixteen I got a license and some gasoline
Theres no curve or a straight away we didnt fly down
It was not the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down by the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
Wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk it could tell about us

If you want to know the real me just turn the page in my dirt road diary
Its right there for you to see
Every kiss every beer every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round windows down on a summer night
I was there that was me
Its right here in my dirt road diary

Its not a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane in my head

Tan legs and some Dixie land delight riding round windows down on a summer night
I was there that was me
Its right here in my dirt road diaries
Just ride around this little town and you will see how I wrote my dirt road diary
You got a lock on your heart its chained in the dark
Somehow you lost the key
You said you tried everything to get love back again
But baby you aint tried me
Bet I could break on through
If you want me to
Tell me what it takes to put a smile on your face
And leave your lonely days behind
I can take it from there get you floatin on air
Girl if you just give me a sign
That you want me to
Do you want me to
My hearts skippin like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel couldnt fall any farther
Help me what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
Out of all the million things that I might dream for
I can only think of one
And its me and you sailin under the blue
Underneath the golden sun
All I want is you
Do you want me too
My hearts skippin like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel couldnt fall any farther
Help me what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
My hearts skippin like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel couldnt fall any farther
Help me what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
Might as well have my alarm
Set on my phone girl
Its like you got a camera
Dont know how you know
Im home alone girl
Come around  every Friday night
Might as well leave the light on
Cause youre always right on time

You call I say hello
You knock Im letting you in
You say youve missed my lips
We kiss here we go again
Your dress my shirt
We love I live and never learn
I crash I burn you leave I hurt
Like clockwork

Its like Im walking down the street
And fall in that same trap girl
I see a freight train coming
And I just stand there on the tracks girl
Somebodyd be getting rich if they were placing bets
On me thinking no no no always saying yes

You call I say hello
You knock Im letting you in
You say youve missed my lips
We kiss here we go again
Your dress my shirt
We love I live and never learn
I crash I burn you leave I hurt
Like clockwork

Its too easy you know my street
And you know where I leave my key
Baby you know me I can count on you to count on me
Its like a movie Ive seen a thousand times
I hate the end but I still hit rewind

You call I say hello
You knock Im letting you in
You say youve missed my lips
We kiss here we go again
Your dress my shirt
We love I live and never learn
I crash I burn you leave I hurt
Like clockwork

Like clockwork clockwork
Clockwork
Like clockwork clockwork
Ive been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone flying blind
Ive seen it all Ive been around
Ive been lost and Ive been found

But who I am with you
Is who I really wanna be
Youre so good for me
And when Im holdin you
It feels like Ive got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you

Ive got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh you make me high
You make me want to hold on tight

Cause who I am with you
Is who I really wanna be
Youre so good for me
And when Im holdin you
It feels like Ive got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you

Because of you  Im a lucky man
And youre the best part of who I am

Youre so good
Youre so good for me baby
And when Im holdin you
It feels like Ive got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you
Yes who I am with you
 oclock on Friday night Im still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he aint worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now theres only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight Ill let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
Ill let him down easy
Cause tonight its all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Im feeling that buzz
Im ready to rock
Aint no way Im gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
Im coming in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh oh oh oh

Hey Bartender
What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender
When Ive been gone when Im right here
The minute my eyes open in the morning
Out on some highway or pulling in the driveway
Clear blue sky or when its thunder storming
My mind just cant escape you
The first time I touched you thats when I knew

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to girl I just want you

When you get rattled or youre coming all unraveled
When your holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me the way that you feel me
The way you know Im holding something inside
Dont know what time has for us
But as long as Im here one thing Im sure of

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to is girl I just want you

Yeah I just want you

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to is girl I just want you

Yes I do
I just want you
Ever since I met you girl you been on my brain
I cant think of nothing else but you all night and day
Its like I got a first class seat up on Ozzys train
Its driving me insane

 somebody call the popo
Im going crazy thinking bout you baby
 just this side of loco
Im going crazy think I love you baby

I gotta get your number girl I gotta call you up
I gotta get you riding shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you Ive got it aint good enough
Yeah you got me all messed up

 somebody call the popo
Im going crazy thinking bout you baby
 just this side of loco
Im going crazy think I love you baby

Cause I aint never felt like this no
And I I just need one kiss from you
And Ill be good as new
If I dont get some of your sweet loving no telling what I might do

 somebody call the popo uhm
I think Im losing my mind girl
 just this side of loco yeah yeah yeah yeah

 somebody call the popo
Im going crazy thinking bout you baby
 spinning my head like a yoyo
Im going crazy think I love you baby
It feels like I woke up one morning
And it all changed without warning
I dont know how our paths crossed
But all I know is Ive been lost
Now its hard to think
That we were ever strangers

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
Ive been on the edge Ive been on the brink
But I dont think Ive ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes Im in love with the girl

I talk about being caught off guard
Talk about an old boy falling hard
Think about a few weeks flying by
And talk about losing track of time
Now Im counting every second until I see her

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
Ive been on the edge Ive been on the brink
But I dont think Ive ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes Im in love with the girl

I was cool with hanging around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Saying things I arent never said
And being with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and dont let go
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes Im in love with the girl
If your dream house
Is a doublewide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby thats where well go
If you dont wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And thats fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

Ill go anywhere
West Virginia baby I dont care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as Im where youre at
Im gonna have a real good view
Ill go anywhere anywhere with you

Ill bet theres a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when

Ill go anywhere
West Virginia baby I dont care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as Im where youre at
Im gonna have a real good view
Ill go anywhere anywhere with you

Ill go anywhere
West Virginia baby I dont care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as Im where youre at
Im gonna have a real good view
Ill go anywhere anywhere with you

Girl Ill swear
Just say the word
Ill take you there
Aww anywhere anywhere with you
Yeah Ill go anywhere with you
No sir I aint been drinking
I aint even had one beer
This sweet things got me buzzin
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister youll understand
Im doing my best

And I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When shes all over me Im all outta control
All over the road

Dont wanna get no ticket
Dont wanna cause no wreck
Its hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say Girl take it easy
She laughs says Itll be fine
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines

Yeah I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When shes all over me Im all outta control
And all over the road

Something bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
Im trying to get her home as fast as I can go

And I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir Im sorry I know
Im all over the road
All over the road
All over the road
I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know youre feeling like you just cant win but youre trying
Its hard to keep on keeping on when youre being pushed around
Dont even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin down round down

Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain

So hold your head up and tell yourself
That theres something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Dont be afraid of the thorns
Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin

Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain

Its gonna run out of pain
Its gonna run out of sting
Its gonna leave you alone
Its gonna set you free set you free

Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain

Its gonna set you free
Its gonna run out of pain
Its gonna set you free
Gonna drive like hell through your neighbourhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank
Sit on the hood and drink
Im about to get my pissed off on
Im gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didnt come here to start a fight but Im up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Wish I knew how long its been going on
How long youve been getting some on the side
Nah he cant amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well he wont be getting any sleep tonight
Im gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didnt come here to start a fight but Im up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Redneck crazy
Did you think Id wish you both the best
Endless love and happiness
You know thats just not the kind of man I am
Yeah Im the kind that shows up at your house at  AM
Im gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didnt come here to start a fight
But Im up for anything tonight
Youve gone and broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy
You drove me redneck crazy oh yeah
Ive been here a bunch of times
It all stats with the same old lines its over baby its over
Nothing about it ever feels good
It knocks you down just like it should
But it goes away it always goes away
Something about this time feels different
Its like Im in a fight Im about to lose

This might be the heartache that dont stop hurting
It just keeps working on me
It just keeps picking on me
And these might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting

Man Ive tried to kill the pain by shooting whiskey through my brain
But it never works it only makes it worse
So tonight Im here again throwing punches in the wind
At some memory that I cant even see
I know that I dont want to let it have me
But every time it hits I feel the truth

This might be the heartache that dont stop hurting
It just keeps working on me
It just keeps picking on me
And these might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting

Tomorrow Ill stand up again
And give it my best shot again
But tonight it sure feels like

These might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting

It just wont stop hurting
A girl like you aint a dime a dozen
A man like me knows that
One look in your eyes is like a one way ticket
And Im aint coming back
We can play it safe or we can ditch this place
Leave em all in the dust
Lets get off like a summer be my stone cold stunner
Hop on in the truck

Lets go lets leave
Theres a whole wide world for our eyes to see
Just roll with me
Cause there aint now doubt this is meant to be
I pick you up on the corner of now and never
We can run all the red lights down forever
Got a tank filled up with gasoline
And a surefire feeling about you and me

Lets pick a road up off the highway
We can see how far it goes
Well kick your seat on back and put your feet on the dash
Well turn on some Rock N Roll
We aint got no destination
No place weve got to be

Cmon get lost with me

Lets go lets leave
Theres a whole wide world for our eyes to see
Just roll with me

We aint happy where we are
Theres greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We aint happy where we are

All I want is what I had
Ill trade it all just to get her back
Shes moving on but I guess Im not
We all want what we aint got

We all wish it didnt hurt
When you try your best and it doesnt work
And goodbyes such a painful word
We all wish it didnt hurt

All I want is what I had

Shes watching the taxi driver he pulls away
Shes been locked up inside her apartment  days
She says Yeah hes still coming just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape
Shes just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles oh the way she smiles

Shes talking to angels counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms yeah in his arms yeah
Waiting for Superman

Shes out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothings making sense
Shes been chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss this Metropolis
She says Yeah hes still coming just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day
She says If life was a movie then it wouldnt end like this
Left without a kiss
Still she smiles oh the way she smiles yeah

Shes talking to angels shes counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers shes falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms yeah in his arms yeah
Shes waiting for Superman

To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love
Flying through the air
Save her now before its too late tonight
Oh at the speed of light
And she smiles

Shes talking to angels shes counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers shes falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms yeah oh in his arms yeah
Shes waiting for Superman

To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love
Flying through the air
Save her now before its too late tonight
Shes waiting for Superman
Ive been thinking bout you all day baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
Its supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like Im going to have to hold you tight yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope its gonna be a long one
And if were lucky its moving slow
I wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Lets go

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That dont bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
Im not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend Im okay
But thats not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin so much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing
What couldve been
And not seein that love in you
Is what I was tryin to do

Its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But Im doin It
Its hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and Im alone
Still harder
Gettin up gettin dressed livin with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin so much to say much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing
What couldve been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do oh

Sit in that sixlane backed up traffic
Horns are honking Ive about had it
Im looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpas attic
A song comes slippin through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some twolane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Ive been cooped up tied down bout forgotten
What a field looks like full of corn and cotton
If Im gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and windatwistin
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my babys hair
Yeah makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some twolane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road
Maybe its the feeling or maybe its the freedom
Maybe its that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some twolane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
Some old back road to the shady spot where things get hot
Some old back road way down way down
Way down some old back road
You know Id fall apart without you
I dont know how you do what you do
Cause everything that dont make sense about me
Makes sense when Im with you
Like everything thats green girl
I need you
But its more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know youre wanted too

Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you youre pretty
You get that all the time I know you do
But your beautys deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
Youre more than everything I need
Youre all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted

Cause youll always be wanted
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a brighteyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis all the way to rock and roll

Oh I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
Oh I can hear em singin
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin every Friday night

Oh I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
Oh I can hear em singin
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin better
You gotta keep believin if you wanna know for sure

Oh I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
Oh I can hear em singin
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
Oh I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
Oh I can hear em singin
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart

Keep on dreamin
Dont let it break your heart
My old mans that old man
Spent his life living off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
Breaks his heart seeing foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isnt ours
And wearing cotton we didnt grow

Hes got the red white blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says USA
Wont buy nothing that he cant fix with WD and a Craftsman wrench
He aint prejudiced hes just made in America

His wife shes that wife that decorates on the th of July
But says every days Independence Day
Shes golden rule teaches school
Some folks say it isnt cool but she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

Got the red white blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says USA
Wont buy nothing that he cant fix with WD and a Craftsman wrench
He aint prejudiced hes just made in America

Born in the heartland raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

Got the red white blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says USA
Wont buy nothing that he cant fix with WD and a Craftsman wrench
He aint prejudiced hes just made in America

Made in America
Made in America
My old mans that old man
Hes made in America
America
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didnt know where it was goin
Just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
I shouldve known that kind of feelin
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin
Sunday came and it was over
Now shes got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
Wed sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just cant get past
Is the way we let it end
Now Im wonderin where she is
Knowin I cant get that goodbye back

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didnt know where it was goin
Just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
I shouldve known that kind of feelin
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin
Sunday came and it was over
Now shes got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

Shes like a song playin over and over
In my mind where I still hold her
I had the chance and I shouldve told her

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I shouldve known where it was goin
Still tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
And I shouldve known that kind of feelin
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin
When Sunday came and it was over
Now shes got me twisted
Yeah Im still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster
We were sitting up there on your mommas roof
Talking bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy so was I
Maybe thats why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But youre about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later Id have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I love you a lot
I think weve got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said Say I do
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not

Are we gonna do this or what
Look at all the love that we got
It aint never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think weve got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not
I see main street closing
Miles of for sale signs
And them fields aint growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until its all alright
Yeah

Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

I dont wanna lose this feeling
And I dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna remember what Im here to forget tonight
So tip it on back

Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

Yeah I dont wanna lose this feeling
I dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna remember what im here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back

Feel the sweet release of a friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a ninepound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in fourwheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hoodsliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddys in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a comeandgetme grin
And like a bullet we were gone again cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking
Ive got some big news
The bank finally came through
And Im holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake
Theres a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the fourwheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

Cause its a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
Ive got the perfect place in mind
Its in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear
I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires


And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires
Hey one two three

Now red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues tailgates fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in  years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass

Now I really love how youre easy to stack
But I really hate how youre easy to crack
Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well that my friends is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

Red Solo cup

And you are the Fruit to my Loom

My oh my youre so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But Ive not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when Im not looking
Do you pour a little something on the rocks
Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress do you leave a path
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath
My oh my youre so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But Ive not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when Im not looking

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

Do you break things when you get mad
Eat a box of chocolates cause youre feeling bad
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails
Call up mamma when all else fails
Who are you when Im not around
When the door is locked and the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly
And when it feels just right are you thinking of me

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

My oh my youre so goodlooking
But who are you when Im not looking
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I dont live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now Im lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it dont seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Dont think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition aint ever going to go away

Now Im knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
Its a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in the waters nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise
Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin to work
Till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said Im your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin
The peaches need pickin
And the cows need bringin round
I was haulin hay I was feedin the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
Then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin out loud thinkin bout quitin
Lookin back now Im sure glad I didnt
Cuz just when I thought it couldnt get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmers daughter
She was just gettin home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So wed hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin her home
And draggin my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
Id be on the tractor shed be on my mind
With that sun beatin down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldnt get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmers daughter
We got married last spring
Woah and there aint no better life for me
Im still haulin hay and feedin the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
Im on the tractor and shes on my mind
And I cant wait till its quitin time
And just when I think it cant get no hotter
I come home to the farmers daughter
Yeah the farmers daughter

July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God youre something
Like nothing Ive ever seen
If Im asleep girl let me dream

Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that theres no one else but us and
This moment that says its so right
Cause thats all we have in this life
Drink up this love baby give it all we got tonight

Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine itll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where were meant to be
Last night outta the blue
Driftin off to the evening news
She said Honey what would you do
If youd never met me
I just laughed said I dont know
But I could take a couple guesses though
And then tried to dig real deep
Said Darling honestly
Id do a lot more offshore fishin
Id probably eat more drivethru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If Id have never known your name
Id still be driving that old green Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well Id be looking for a woman like you
I could tell that got her attention
So I said Oh yeah I forgot to mention
I wouldnt trade a single day
For a hundred years the other way
She just smiled and rolled her eyes
Cause shes heard all of my lines
I said Cmon on girl seriously
If I hadnt been so lucky
Id be shootin pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
Play poker every Tuesday night yeah
Id have a dirt bike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
Id keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well Id be looking for a woman like you
She knows what a mess Id be if I didnt have her here
But to be sure I whispered in her ear
You know I get sick deepsea fishin
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green Nova
But I love watchin you do yoga
Id take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly I dont know what Id do
If Id never met a woman like you
Aint nothin goin on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin too much beer
So baby tell me would it be all right
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
Im sure we could find somethin to do
As a matter of fact baby why dont you

Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while youre at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Yeah I can take it from there

Im gonna put an old record on
Conway Twitty yeah girl Id love to lay you down
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Aint gonna stop lovin you til the candle burns out
Oh there it is that little smile of yours
Come on baby what ya waiting for

Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while youre at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there

Tomorrows gonna be here way too soon
Lets not waste another minute girl
I got plans for me and you

Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and darlin turn down those lights
Baby while youre at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Oh I can take it from there
I can take it from there yeah yeah
To kiss and tell its just not my style
But the night is young and its been awhile and she broke my heart broke it right in two
And it took some time but Im feeling like Im finally ready to find find somebody new

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Its that moment when you start closing in
First youre holding back then surrendering
It can start a fire light up the sky such a simple thing
Do you wanna try
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives oh yeah
Are you ready Are you readyto cross that line put your lips on mine
Put your lips on mine baby
Do you wanna try
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely I shouldnt be lonely

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl
The trouble with girls is theyre a mystery
Something about em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls is theyre so dang pretty
Everything about em does something to me
But I guess thats the way its supposed to be

They smile that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with hello
They kill you with goodbye
They hook you with one touch and you cant break free
Yeah the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

Theyre sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night down by the lake
An old memory that you cant shake
Theyre hard to find yet theres so many of em
The way that you hate that you already love em
But I guess thats the way its supposed to be

They smile that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with hello
They kill you with goodbye
They hook you with one touch and you cant break free
Yeah the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say
Stay

They smile that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with hello
They kill you with goodbye
They hook you with one touch and you cant break free
Yeah the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me
I cant sleep
There is no sleep coming
Im just lying here thinking about you
Im in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything were going to do
Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side

Its going to be a long hot summer we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight

Its going to be a long hot summer we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

Its going to be a long hot summer we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

I swear its like youre waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey yeah
Oh Im loving thinking about you
I cant sleep Im just lying here thinking about you
Tshirt blue jeans
Dont like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut
Arent non Redeye gravy on a biscuit
My deep Southern drawl
Makes the conversation crawl
Youre going to have to hang around
Long enough to hear me out
Some folks arent happy like they are
Some want to take things just a little too far

Singers want to be Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
Im just what you see
So Ill make it easy
Ill stay me

My granny and pawpaw
Still missing Hee Haw
And I love my little town
Where the people dont let you down
Theres a girl down the street
Got a kiss just waiting on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries
When I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touching her love loving
Hardworking man

Quarterbacks want to play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes
But I still believe
Im going to make it easy
Ill stay me

Yeah singers want to be
Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
Im just what you see
So Ill make it easy
Ill stay me

Ill stay me Im going to make it easy
Ill stay me
I arent been doing to right
Since I met her last night
Some kind of burning breakfast
Lost at work state of mind
Were meeting here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kind of sushi veggie raw and edgy natural stuff
But Im feeling out of place
But babys on the way

Im just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something shes got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey hey babys on the way

Arent going to try those lines
Been used so many times
Like when you fell from heaven did it hurt and did you cry
Im just going to wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my get to know her better file
Hey its a real good day
Cause babys on the way

Im just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something shes got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey hey babys on the way
Oh yeah yeah

Its just a simple case of cant wait
Got to be great to see her again
Got to be tough to hide whats inside
And in my eyes when she walks in

Im just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something shes got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey hey babys on the way

Hey yeah my babys on the way
Yeah yeah babys on the way
Back in my day i was always
Cruising the road on sunday
Making those tires spin your way
Yeah it seems like yesterday
Wed go swinging on the front porch
You were all mine and i was all yours
Yeah those are the days i miss
A ten minute ride i could make it in five

This might sound crazy but maybe
Youre thinking bout me tonight
Cause im thinking bout you tonight
Something bout the taste of a first love first touch
That dont ever seem to fade
Now youre  miles away
And a ten hour drive
But if you called me tonight

The last i heard you were on the west coast
Looking hotter than a texas summer
Yeah girl i cant help but wonder
What youve seen what youve missed
What youve felt whove you kissed
Girl you never crossed my mind
Yeah you stay there all the time

And this might sound crazy but maybe
Youre thinking bout me tonight

Something bout the taste of a first love first touch

Now youre  miles away

Looking for your area code or some number yeah that i dont know
But the one that came up tonight is the one ive known all my life
Its your mamas place and i heard your pretty voice say

There aint much to do here in this town
When the work is done and the sun goes down
Theres a place that we all go
Where its two for one just to watch the show
Yeah me and the boys hanging around
Hands in our pockets getting lost in the crowd

Watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
Swinging their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
Theyre singing along singing along
Aint nothing like getting right
Chasing a buzz with a cold bud light
Watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys yeah

Yeah you ought to see them in summer time
They cant wait to show off those tan lines
Out at a cove that we all know
Where its string bikinis and tied up boats
Out in the sun all getting baked
Me and the boys kicking back in our shades

Watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
Swinging their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
Theyre singing along singing along
Aint nothing like getting right
Chasing a buzz with a cold bud light
Watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys yeah

Call me lazy drunk or crazy
But i aint ever gonna move
Nah cause you cant beat this view
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
You got my mind thinking

Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Swinging their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
Theyre singing along singing along

Chasing a buzz with a cold bud light
Watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Pretty girls drinking tall boys

Pretty girls drinking pretty girls drinking
Pretty girls drinking tall boys
Got my mind thinking
Bout pretty girls drinking
Swinging their hips to a country song
We used to pull off Highway 
Had a cool little place where wed go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
Wed find a little wood and build a fire
Somebodyd always bring a couple guitars
And wed take turns singin songs and watching it burn
Wed do Ramblin Man Proud Mary and American Band
Wed be singin at the top of our lungs

It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs

There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you couldve said
But you both knew they were singin it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart you couldnt take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin songs we could do em all night long
But the ones we remember most

It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs

Wed be singin at the top of our lungs

It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs
Always the love songs always the love songs
Saturday night and a six pack girl
Big star shining on a small town world
Its a helluva life its a helluva life
And KC lights on a dirt road dance
You take that kiss just as far as you can
Its a helluva life oh its a helluva life

And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin
To a song thats playing on the radio station
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and youre gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah its a helluva life
Its a helluva life

And we all have faith and we all have hope
But were all a little lost in the same damn boat
Its a helluva life yeah its a helluva life
Something bout the night girl
When you got the right girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky girl
Thinking bout why were here
And where were going
Baby here we are
And all I know is

Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin
To a song thats playing the world starts fadin
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and youre gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah its a helluva life
Its a helluva life

Something bout the night girl
When you got the right girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky girl
Thinking bout why were here
And where were going
Baby here we are

Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin
To a song thats playing its the perfect combination

On a heavenly ride

Bad times make the good times better
Aw one helluva life
Look in her eyes and youre gone forever

Shes got a bumper like a billboard
Covered in stickers of her favorite band
Shes got a handful of records that she turns to
When she needs to land
Shes a Saturday night parade through the streets
That all eyes come to see including me
She carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets
She should have let some go by now but cant seem to drop it
Says forgiveness aint nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul
That never rolls

For as much as she stumbled shes runnin
For as much as she runs shes still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh just like Guinevere

She dont hold onto nothin new for very long
Yeah she writes you in as just one more tale and then youre gone
Cause she once fell hard cause she dropped her guard
And no one gets to stay its just too late

For as much as she stumbled shes runnin
For as much as she runs shes still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh just like Guinevere

For as much as she stumbled shes runnin
For as much as she runs shes still here

For as much as she stumbled shes runnin
For as much as she runs shes still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh just like Guinevere

Oh lean into me Guinevere
Be mine tonight Guinevere
You slip your finger through the tear in my tshirt
You stirrin up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin cause you know that its workin
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldnt sing this song without you if I tried
Lets light it up like its our last night

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
Im just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down

Girl when you want it
You know that Im on it
You know that I love lovin up on you
Lets hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like its our last chance

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin in my bed
Im just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me with me

Just to feel your heartbeat against me against me
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me with me
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  against me

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed

You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down

Just to feel your heartbeat against me

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight dance with your boots in it dirt
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field whiskey bonfires on it dirt
You bet your life on it yeah
Its that

Elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blueeyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a  percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children one died at birth they were tough times tough years did okay

Youve mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
Youve stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it dirt
You know you came from it dirt
And some day youll return to

Elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blueeyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a  percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

You know you came from it dirt dirt And some day youll return to

Elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blueeyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a  percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build a  percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

You know you came from it and some day youll return to it
Sitting here at the FloraBama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
In the same night

Theres ball caps photographs dollar bills and bras
License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers heart breakers already getting loud
Talladegas on the big screen dont it make you proud

Sitting here at the FloraBama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Cant say I got a whole lot of cares
Im in the redneck riviera
Its getting crazy getting hammered
Sitting right here at the FloraBama
At the FloraBama

Theres hot time low tide years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign that says live your life just for inspiration
Gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the in the no shoes nation

Sitting here at the FloraBama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Cant say I got a whole lot of cares
Im in the redneck riviera
Its getting crazy getting hammered
Sitting right here at the FloraBama
At the FloraBama

Got your who that go Vols roll tide and the Seminoles
Old dogs war eagle greeneyed gator thats barely legal

Sitting here at the FloraBama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Cant say I got a whole lot of cares
Im in the redneck riviera
Its getting crazy getting hammered
Sitting right here at the FloraBama
At the FloraBama

Dont it feel good
Dont it feel good
Yeah dont it feel good
At the FloraBama
Sitting here at the FloraBama
Sitting here at the FloraBama
Im feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkeytonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pilled my hat down low wouldnt want you to know I was in this shape

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
Bout to burn out
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips cant muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart

You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now thats really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
Bout to burn out
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips cant muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
Bout to burn out
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips cant muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But theyre still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah theyre still doing better
Better than my heart
Better than my heart
Snapbacks and Levi jeans
PBR and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
Were still working on our summer feet
Cheap gas and Reddy ice
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
A pretty girl and a pickup line like
Hey whats your name you know smoke follows beauty baby

We stayed up all night long made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like ohohoh oh oh
Breaking our boots in stompin on the ground we grew up on
Yeah we were raised on it raised on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck
s with a  on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin from your ex at the way stop
Turn the music down when youre passing the cops

We stayed up all night long made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like ohohoh oh oh
Breaking our boots in stompin on the ground we grew up on
Yeah we were raised on it raised on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mamas prayers and daddys speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

We stayed up all night long made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like ohohoh oh oh
Breaking our boots in stompin on the ground we grew up on
Yeah we were raised on it raised on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mmm yeah
When that sun starts sinking
When they turn those open signs around
We thought we ran this town
Running around just
Breaking hearts and curfew
Out in the yard with no shoes
Staying cool in a Nylon pool
Foul ball headed for the parking lot
And those Saturday mornings we sleep late
ATVs and fire breaks
Worn out jeans black eyed peas backroads and blue skies
I was born and raised on it
Might have misbehaved on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made
Youre like a sugarsweet kiss in the morning
Sunshine pouring right into my window
Cool drink of water in the summer
Better than the other side of the pillow
Youre everything that Im not and then a cherry on top
Yeah girl I gotta see you tonight
Yeah Im taking you out cause damn baby Im proud

When a guy like me
Gets a girl like you
Yeah you better know were going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what Im crazy about
Anywhere we go
Gotta let em all know
And Imma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby I just wanna show you off

You gotta boy feeling lucky how you love me
And youre making my heart go
Ticking like a time bomb baby when the top drops
And Im watching your hair blow
No I dont wanna miss another kiss on your lips
Yeah girl I gotta see you tonight
Pick you up about  counting down I cant wait


Yeah show you off
Oh baby I just want to show you off
When a guy like me gets a girl like you
You better know what Im gonna do
What Im gonna do yeah


Yeah show you of
Baby I just wanna show you off
The jokes on me and it aint funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
Ive heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes

A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

Id laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
Im walking talking drinking proof
A clich in a corner booth
Aint nothing new

A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar


A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar
Long truck bed hop in it fire engine red like her lipstick
Out here we can let it go yeah
Just me and my good friends jug of wine lil sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah these are the days of gold

Well its a Southern summer
Whiskeys in the air dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddys silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

The July sky so high moon shining by the river side
Stealing hearts and running wild
In our own little world Tennessee boys and girls running free
Out here its good times for miles
Yeah these are the days of gold

Well its a Southern summer
Whiskeys in the air dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddys silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little bit of you a little bit of me
What you want to do whats it going to be
We can get a wild we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your backs sticking to the seat
We can sneak off to beat the heat
Ill be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee

Well its a Southern summer
Whiskeys in the air dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddys silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold
No sir I aint been drinking
I aint even had one beer
This sweet things got me buzzin
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister youll understand
Im doing my best

And I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When shes all over me Im all outta control
All over the road

Dont wanna get no ticket
Dont wanna cause no wreck
Its hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say Girl take it easy
She laughs says Itll be fine
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines

Yeah I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When shes all over me Im all outta control
And all over the road

Something bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
Im trying to get her home as fast as I can go

And I know Im all over the road
I cant help but go
A little bit of left a little bit of right
Its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir Im sorry I know
Im all over the road
All over the road
All over the road
Driving through town
Just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldnt have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went aflying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with S and I was concerned
So I said Son now where did you learn to talk like that

He said Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So Ive been watching you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said Lord please help me help my stupid self
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my sons Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said Son now whered you learn to pray like that

He said Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mamas hand
Yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So Ive been watching you

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said My little bear is growing up
He said But when Im big Ill still know what to do

Cause Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then Ill be as strong as superman
Well be just alike hey wont we dad
When I can do everything you do
Cause Ive been watching you
Youve got a cousin whos telling you somethin
That doesnt have nothin to do with the lovin that were in baby
I hear shes sayin this game were playin should be complicated
If you wont Ill say it I think shes crazy cause

Love dont have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knockdown dragouts cryin in the rain
Its all right to keep it light now mama dont you think
Were having such a good time together and its only just begun
My hearts never smiled so hard
Baby lovin you is fun

Im walkin around all over this town ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you baby I love it
Theres no selfhelp book on your shelf you know too well
Theyre trying to sell you somethin for nothin cause

A bunch of knockdown dragouts cryin in the rain
Its all right to keep it light now mama dont you think

Baby lovin you is fun
Love dont have to be a bunch of drama

From that first second
I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know Ive been going crazy over you
Here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right

Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Lets shake the sand off the sheets

This cant be no buzz from the salt in the air
I arent never had no drink do me like this I swear
Feels like Im spinning around watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right
Before I hit the lights

Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Lets shake the sand off the sheets

So Ill just keep holding on
Loving you all night long

Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Lets shake the sand off the sheets
I woke up again this morning
And wouldnt you know it pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

Cause I didnt know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad come back song

I know I said I wouldnt miss you
But now Im saying Im a fool
Youre on the feel good side of leaving
And Im the backside of a mule

And I didnt know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song

And now Im laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But Ill just dream of you instead


Hey I didnt know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad come back song

Oh yeah yeah
I know I said I wouldnt miss you
I said I wouldnt miss you girl yeah

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na yeah
Come on now
This is my my bad come back song
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills arent going to pay themselves
Dont matter anyway
Cause I aint in no hurry today
Theres nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a foldup easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldnt have it any other way
Cause I aint in no hurry today

Aint in no hurry
Id be a fool now to worry
About all those things I cant change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I aint in no hurry today

When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down

Heaven knows that I aint perfect
Ive raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
Going to get right with the lord
But therell be hell to pay
But Im in no hurry

Aint in no hurry
Id be a fool now to worry
About all those things I cant change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I aint in no hurry today
Aint in no hurry
Aint in no hurry today
Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
Theres the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the games about to start

I dont really know how I got here
But Im sure glad that I did
And its crazy to think that one little thing
Couldve changed all of it
Maybe it didnt turn out like I planned
Maybe thats why Im such such a lucky man

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to
This

Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter

All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought Id never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you
I didnt understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

How I cried when my mama passed away
But now Ive got an angel looking out for me today
So nothings a mistake

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

It led me here to
This
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said Id enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasnt turning round
No not this time

But dont think I dont think about it
Dont think I dont have regrets
Dont think it dont get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But dont think I dont think about it

When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away

But dont think I dont think about it
Dont think I dont have regrets
Dont think it dont get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But dont think I dont think about it
Dont think I dont think about it

But dont think I dont think about it
Dont think I dont have regrets
Dont think it dont get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But dont think I dont think about it

No no
Dont think I dont
Dont think I dont
Mmm
Hey girl Im just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
Im more a fishin in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that

When Im with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one were travelin on girl
And Im bettin that its gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that Im gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin
So baby lets take it take it

Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that

I aint gonna do it like a pretty city boy
Im a fishin in the dark nitty gritty boy
So let me love you

Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that

Baby I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that
A woman is mystery
A man just cant understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows theres so many ways
A man can go wrong

Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doing something right

Anywhere you want to go
Baby show me the way
Im open to suggestions
Mmm whatever you say
Tonights about giving you
What you want whatever it takes
Girl I hope Im on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doing something right

Ah Baby
Mmm

I dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doin something right
Must be doin something right
Here we are making all our big plans
Jumping way into the deep end
Hey girl why dont we just leave tonight
Pack it up drive until the road ends
Feels like this can be the moment
Weve been waiting on all our lives
We know were ready
It may sound crazy
Cause we got no money
Nothing on our own honey
Got your daddy all worried
Cause times are tough
We got love baby
It dont sound like much maybe
There aint no way thats not enough
Cause we got us
They say lifes not a love song I think everybodys all wrong
So far forever sounds good to me
Weve got California moonlight
Enough gas to make it to the sunrise
And two hearts believing
Thats all wed need
Nothing heres missing
This is what I call living
Cause we got no money
Nothing of our own honey
Got your daddy all worried
Cause times are tough
We got love baby
It dont sound like much maybe
There aint no way thats not enough
We got us
Oh weve come too far to turn around
Nothing can stop us not now
Someday were gonna laugh
At the way things used to be
When we had no money
Nothing of our own honey
We had your daddy all worried
Cause times were tough
We got love baby
It dont sound like much maybe
There aint no way thats not enough
Cause we got us cause we got us yeah yeah
So here we are here all alone
The band quit playing everyone went home
But the stars are still out and youre so damn hot
And I aint ready for the music to stop

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my Oh hell yeah
I feel a little singalong singalong coming on
Baby be my love song

Girl fast or slow threequarter time
It dont have to make sense and it dont have to rhyme
As long as its you babe Im all in
And when its over just play it again

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance

My little feel good that gets to me

I feel a little singalong singalong coming on
Baby be my love song
Baby be my love song
Oh yeah
Be my love song
Be my love song
Its rolling in the wind you can see it in the air
Where I come from man its everywhere
Coming up in a cloud behind a one way plow
Colors up the sky when the sun goes down

Oh drifting up and down that main street drag
Oh may even wrote her name with it up on the dash

Dust in the rearview in the cedar
Dust on the bottle coming out of them speakers
Dust on my boots dust on my truck
Probably got a little running in my blood
From the road I ride with that laid back seat
Shes sitting in on the passenger side
Everything I know everything I love
Is covered up in dust

When the moon comes up it kind of settles on down
But we stir it back up when were riding around
Dust on the top of a cold beer can
Before I take a sip I wipe it off with my hand

Oh couple of days without no rain
Oh she can spot me coming from a mile away

Dust in the rearview in the cedar
Dust on the bottle coming out of them speakers
Dust on my boots dust on my truck
Probably got a little running in my blood
From the road I ride with that laid back seat
Shes sitting in on the passenger side
Everything I know everything I love
Is covered up in dust

Oh drifting up and down that main street drag
Oh may even wrote her name with it up on the dash

Dust in the rearview in the cedar
Dust on the bottle coming out of them speakers
Dust on my boots dust on my truck
Probably got a little running in my blood
From the road I ride with that laid back seat
Shes sitting in on the passenger side
Everything I know everything I love
Is covered up in dust
Is covered up in dust
Is covered up in dust
Is covered up in dust
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honkytonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

She said rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Yesterdays nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While Im wearing out roads dont you know that Im sure missing you
If I leave youll be wondering when Ill be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

She said rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Come on

Hey rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider
Swore I was going to tell em the truth
That was til everybody started asking bout you
And I didnt know what to say
Came up with some lame excuse
Why you were gone
Said you were gonna come later on
Painted a smile on my face
Like everything was okay

I was hanging around rockin the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see Im dying inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

And then one of your friends
Came up and gave me a hug and asked me
How wed been
I smiled and said were better than weve ever been
Well I dont know why I had to lie
Guess I didnt wanna tell her that you said goodbye
I couldnt even look her in the eye
So I kept on

Hanging around rockin the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see Im dying inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

Everybody thinking Im feeling good
Everybody thinking Im havin a real good time
Dont know the truth about you and I

So Im hanging around rockin the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see Im dying inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party
Life of the party
Life of the party
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

Swore I was going to tell em the truth
But I didnt know what to say
Well I come from a little bitty homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains nice place to hang around
Moonshine thats where they make it
Put it in a jug makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a longlegged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well my friends back home think Ive gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen willing and able
Dont know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a longlegged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars

I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a longlegged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please dont stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her greeneyed girl was a mother to be for  weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please dont stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I cant say where she is today
I cant remember who I was back then
Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And theres no such thing as what mightve been
Thats a waste of time drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash
I did it for the girl dancin in the sunset
Get to see her sippin on Corona little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight slow ride slidin over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss I did it for the girl
I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the waters edge big sky turnin red
That perfect night she said she cant forget
I did it for the girl dancin in the sunset
Get to see her sippin on Corona little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight slow ride slidin over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss I did it for the girl
I did it for that long hair fallin down layin on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her
I did it for the girl dancin in the sunset
Get to see her sippin on Corona little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight slow ride slidin over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl dancin on the front porch
Reachin out to grab my shirt pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight candlelight
Anything to make her mine all mine I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl
When Ive been gone when Im right here
The minute my eyes open in the morning
Out on some highway or pulling in the driveway
Clear blue sky or when its thunder storming
My mind just cant escape you
The first time I touched you thats when I knew

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to girl I just want you

When you get rattled or youre coming all unraveled
When your holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me the way that you feel me
The way you know Im holding something inside
Dont know what time has for us
But as long as Im here one thing Im sure of

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to is girl I just want you

Yeah I just want you

I want you trust me I want you to love me
I want you to need me like Im something you cant lose
I want you to save me I want you to crave me
Even when I cant find my way to you
If you ever once doubt anything Im about
All it ever comes down to is girl I just want you

Yes I do
I just want you
Rearview crosses
Railroad ties
Oh Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Lowbeam lights
God I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

In a sleepy town just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us we cant go back
Its what it is but God I miss

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Every beat every line every word every single time
I just close my eyes and youre ridin shotgun
You and me baby on the run
I miss you baby
I miss you baby
I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh but you aint gone
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
Youre dancing all around it girl you got me surrounded
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl Im no better off cant get you outta my head
Seems like your memory has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd I hear you whispering baby
Its driving me crazy
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
Youre dancing all around it girl you got me surrounded
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl Im no better off cant get you outta my head
Damn youre hard to forget
Oh oh oh
Yeah wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
Youre dancing all around it you still got me surrounded
Yeah yeah cant get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl Im no better off cant get you outta my head
Youre nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mmm outta my head
No you aint gone
No you aint gone
Yeah outta my head
Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town hey wouldnt you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico oh
Now youre walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well theres a move or two Id like to show you
While I still got the chance

Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

Oh oh why wouldnt I wanna stay
Oh oh and let that plane fly away hey hey

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what Im saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that Ill lose it
You got my heart racing like theres nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
Were falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Aint never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
Ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
Youre still lying there when it comes back up

Girl what do you say
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
Ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
Ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how
Country feels
Country feels
Alright
Yea its been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast pedal hard
You wont have to go that far
You want to give up cause its dark
Were really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when youre lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When its all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what youll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone
Forgot directions on your way
Dont close your eyes dont be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I cant wait til you arrive
Follow stars youll be alright
You want to give up cause its dark
Were really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when youre lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When its all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what youll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone
You want to give up cause its dark
Were really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when youre lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When its all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what youll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone
When its all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what youll never be alone
So we had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart and achin head and no regrets
Who knows we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name
Could it be Im finally holding
What Ive been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way Im feeling now
Its worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Rule number one
Friends dont break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I dont want to be alone tonight
Who knows we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name
Could it be Im finally holding
What Ive been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way Im feeling now
Its worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be Im finally holding
What Ive been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way Im feeling now
Its worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Is this love
Or could it be
To kiss and tell its just not my style
But the night is young and its been awhile and she broke my heart broke it right in two
And it took some time but Im feeling like Im finally ready to find find somebody new

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Its that moment when you start closing in
First youre holding back then surrendering
It can start a fire light up the sky such a simple thing
Do you wanna try
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives oh yeah
Are you ready Are you readyto cross that line put your lips on mine
Put your lips on mine baby
Do you wanna try
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely I shouldnt be lonely

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl
Ella es la mujer mas bella conquista a cualquiera su cara bonita
No te fies de su belleza una rosa tierna tambien tiene espinas
Es callejon sin salida una yena herida experta en venganza
Cuando menos lo imaginas destruira tu vida es Mujer De Doble Cara
Ella es un caso perdido si tu ya has caido cuanto lo lamento
Los hombres se los come vivos es el paraiso o el mismo infierno
Es ladrona de ilusiones deja que te enamores y despues te usa
Es la amante de una noche la bala de un revolver en una ruleta rusa
Es sensual y vanidosa de armas y rosas es trampa mortal
Es la mas linda de todas hiedra venenosa que no deja escapar
Me ama aunque no me lo diga ojos de asesina como navaja
Es verdad y es mentira yo se que es mia aunque duerma en otra cama
Ella es agua entre las manos otro del bocado que nadie domo
Una virgen del rosario cruz de tu calvario muerte y resurrecion
Es la adiccion que te enferma el vicio que no dejas aunque te hace mal
En el engao es maestra una viuda negra que dormido te puede matar
Que no te enamore su rostro si miras sus ojos te robara el alma
Por ella lo dejaras todo si te vuelves loco te deja sin nada
Es el vicio mas extremo el ardiente fuego tentacion fatal
Droga que le tira el cuerpo pasion y deseo la manzana que comio adan
Ella es un angel sin alas te miente en la cara y te deja contento
Es mujer de doble cara puede ser la mala o la buena del cuento
Es una dama del diablo sus besos son caros como la ceda
Tienes que andar con cuidado si eres atrapado seras otra de sus presas
Clothes scattered across the bedroom floor
Soaking wet towel hanging on the door
Looks like a hurricane just came through
Her makeup covers up
Every inch of the counter top
Shes slappin on a little bit of strawberry lip gloss
Shes ready to rock
Shes my hot mess in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
Shes got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin up and down turning them heads
Shes my little hot mess
When she gets to dancin to the band
Them shoes gonna wind up in her hand
Barefoot and groovin like nobodys watchin
She gonna cut up and drink a little
Play them boys like a bluegrass fiddle
The rave of the partys at
Oh shes right there in the middle
Shes my hot mess in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
Shes got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin up and down turning them heads
Shes my little hot mess
Every guy in here tonight wants to take her home
But in the morning shes gonna wake up with my tshirt on
Shes my hot mess in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
Shes got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin up and down turning them heads
Shes my little hot mess
Shes my little hot mess
Yes she is
She was pretty bout 
When She moved in down my street
Still dont know what she saw in me
I guess she like the way I made her laugh
She wanted more than what friends have
She kissed me once and we never looked back
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
In the woods in my Grandpas barn
In The Backseat of my car
She said it doesnt matter where we are
She made me thirst for a womans love
I kept drinking couldnt get enough
Yeah there was magic in her velvet touch
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
The leaves changed and the sky turned grey
Her Daddys job took her away
I can still see the tears rolling down her face
Oh Yeah
First time was down by the river
Our sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And drive me crazy
Baby drive me crazy
She was pretty bout 
When She moved in down my street
Still dont know what she saw in me
I guess she like the way I made her laugh
She wanted more than what friends have
She kissed me once and we never looked back
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
In the woods in my Grandpas barn
In The Backseat of my car
She said it doesnt matter where we are
She made me thirst for a womans love
I kept drinking couldnt get enough
Yeah there was magic in her velvet touch
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
The leaves changed and the sky turned grey
Her Daddys job took her away
I can still see the tears rolling down her face
Oh Yeah

Our sweat made both us shiver
Dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath the only sound
Baby darling she said take me
And drive me crazy
Baby drive me crazy
I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now its climbing with a bullet
Its nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when its said and done girl I hope you know that

The traveling the singing it dont mean nothing without you
The fast cars the guitars they are all just second to
This life this love that you and Ive been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Oh Without you yea yea

Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because Im part of you
Man its tough to figure
How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other

The traveling the singing it dont mean nothing without you
The fast cars the guitars they are all just second to
This life this love that you and Ive been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Oh Without you yea yea

Without you Id survive
But Id have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions

The traveling the singing it dont mean nothing without you
The fast cars the guitars they are all just second to
This life this love that you and Ive been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you
Lets get into the point when we are not listening anymore
Just walking round in circles and wearing holes out in the floor
Im tired I know youre tired and its late
And its almost four
What are you trying to achieve
What are you trying to win
I said the same thing three hours ago
And now Im saying it again
And I know you well enough to know
Neither one of us is giving in

Baby I love you Im not going to bed angry
Baby I need you and I want you to be happy
Weve been going around in circles with no end in sight
Maybe we should just
Shut out the lights
And wait till the morning
Shut out the lights
Wait till the morning
Yeah

Its amazing all the awkward moments
We still carry around
We wait to bring it all up when it all comes down
The light is coming right now

Baby I love you Im not going to bed angry
Baby I need you and I want you to be happy
Weve been going around in circles with no end in sight
Maybe we should just
Shut out the lights
And wait till the morning
Shut out the lights
Wait till the morning
Yeah

Because I dont want to lose you
And I dont want to hurt you
I dont want to feel these
The times that Im going to to make you say
Things you dont mean in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment

Baby I love you Im not going to bed angry
Baby I need you and I want you to be happy
Weve been going around in circles with no end in sight
Maybe we should just
Shut out the lights
And wait till the morning
Shut out the lights
Wait till the morning
Yeah

Just give it some time
Just a little bit of time
Its goning to be alright
In the morning light
Because I need you
Ill never settle down
Thats what I always thought
Yeah I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
I dont dance But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Aint my style but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yes you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause I dont dance
Loves never come my way
Ive never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No I dont dance but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It aint my style but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yes you got me in the palm of your hand girl
Cause I dont dance
Ohhh

Spinning you around and around in circles
It aint my style but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand girl
Cause I dont dance
Oh

Oooh
The rains coming down hard tonight
Pull the car over
Now Im sitting alone on the roadside
I tilt the mirror down and say to me
Why you always think the answers got to be
To just leave
Im making the same mistake
Im hoping its not too late
Because I

I dont know where I would be without you now
I guess I get scared and thats why I act like such a fool
Because youre the one thing I cant lose
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

I never felt it
I never knew
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do
Yes you do
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
Its beautiful and terrifying
Cant you see
For someone like me
But instead of running in
I know
Its when I should hold you closer
Because I

I dont know where I would be without you now
I guess I get scared and thats why I act like such a fool
Because youre the one thing I cant lose
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you
I dont know where I would be without you now
I guess I get scared and thats why I act like such a fool
Because youre the one thing I cant lose
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

Because nobodys ever loved me
Like you
And I was born to be your man forever
Forever baby

Yeah
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I turn the car around
And put it in drive
And I know what to do
Going to come on back
Come on back to you
Yeah

Oh oh baby
Going to come on back
Come on back to you
Because I cant live without you
I cant breathe without you
Yeah
And Im nothing Im nothing
Without you
Yeah
I was a fool I was a fool baby
They roll the sidewalks in this town all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin down would be in vain I cant sleep with you on my brain
And I aint anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl you got the beat right killin in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
Its still early out in Cali baby dont you wanna rally again
Well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
Well be rolling down the windows I bet you were catchin our second wind
We dont have to go home we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin blue just kissed the clock 
Baby I know what youre wishin for Im wishin for it too
Now all the lights are flashin gold nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtracks in the stereo
The DJs on a roll

Girl you got the beat right killin in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
Its still early out in Cali baby dont you wanna rally again
Well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
Well be rolling down the windows I bet you were catchin our second wind
We dont have to go home we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

The sunll steal the magic from us soon
So lets take one more trip around the moon

Girl you got the beat right killin in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
Its still early out in Cali baby dont you wanna rally
Well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
Well be rolling down the windows I bet you were catchin our second wind
We dont have to go home we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin like a streetlight
We can leave em on tonight
If I could be the reason your hairs a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

And oh all of this talking makes you laugh
But Ive gotta let you know
Just how I feel while im

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

Yeah if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me
Be what you mean to me
Ohhhhh be what you mean
What you mean what you mean
What you mean to me mmmmmm

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and were feeling cool as cash
The night is on like you aint even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned like you aint even gone

Sunset twilight Friday night
Round back chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband peace sign looking fly shotgun
Bullet going straight through a street sign

You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when youre crying
If I said I wasnt missing you Id be lying
Well the truth is well the truth is

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hands back and were feeling cool as cash
The night is on another moonlight ride like you aint even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned it still feels so right
Like you aint even gone like you aint even gone

Midnight calling me looking for trouble
Slipping them should have beens in my ear
Got me shooting down that girls memory double
That blue eyes summer smoke sunburn red smile
Said you were leaving this town got to runaway
I watched you run away and girl you should have chased down

Those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when youre crying
If I said I wasnt missing you Id be lying
Cause the truth is girl the truth is

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hands back and were feeling cool as cash
The night is on another moonlight ride like you aint even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned it still feels so right
Like you aint even gone like you aint even gone
The bluest skies dont seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that youre around you put em all to shame
Let me break it down cause what Im trying to say is

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didnt have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Gotta whole new direction it seems these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different I cant leave you alone

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didnt have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Girl if you ever get to guessing if Im thinking bout you
Just remember that

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didnt have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you you you
You oh you
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Cant drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh even though youre gone somehow you stay

And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off shake it off
Pour another drink so I dont feel a thing
I just shake it off break it off
Erased all your numbers blocked all your calls
Tried another lover built up my walls
Told myself its over dont know what else I can do
I cant shake you

I didnt wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I dont wanna see you
But Im wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin
The shirt you used to sleep in
Its been sittin there for over a year
Oh even though you left me youre still here

And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off shake it off
Pour another drink so I dont feel a thing
I just shake it off break it off
Erased all your numbers blocked all your calls
Tried another lover built up my walls
Told myself its over dont know what else I can do
I cant shake you

I cant shake you
No matter how hard I try
I cant shake you
I cant shake you
And I dont know why

And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off shake it off
Pour another drink so I dont feel a thing
I just shake it off break it off
Erased all your numbers blocked all your calls
Tried another lover built up my walls
Told myself its over dont know what else I can do
I cant shake you
I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasnt scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Ive kissed you
Its a good night good night baby goodnight

You couldnt see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldnt go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall

So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock you turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Ive kissed you
Its a good night good night baby goodnight

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Half scared to death cant catch my breath
Arent these the moments we live for

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Ive kissed you
Its a good night good night baby goodnight
Its a good night good night baby goodnight
Its a good night good night baby goodnight
Its a good night good night baby goodnight
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didnt have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
Shed found what shed been looking for
And I knew it wasnt me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I dont think I can change it
Theres no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Cant wash off his makeup
The life she wanted it was gone
Prince Charming I wasnt
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh but like the tide her love has come and gone
And its time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I dont think I can change it
Theres no way to disguise
We will never make it now she sees right through me
Should I hold on to what we have got
Is it just a waste of time
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine so did I
So did I
So dont smile at me if it aint what you mean
Goodbye

With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I cant change it now you see right through me
Theres no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I cant change it now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes
Should I hold on
We will never make it now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes
Should I hold on
Is it just a waste of time
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes

I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that its over
Girl I know I dont know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
Im so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is its going good

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know that the rising sun
Aint no good for me
Cause youll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 
Theres plenty of gas and the nights still alive

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end


You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end
I dont want this night to end
No I dont want this night to end
Theres a place that they call Heaven
Just south of town way up on a hill
They say you can see for miles
When the sun goes down time stands still
No Ive never been up to Heaven
But Ive always wanted to go
Its ten miles down highway eleven
And ten more minutes up the old dirt road

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe youd feel like taking a drive
Cause I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Well theres a store on the way to Heaven
They oughta have everything we need
A bag of ice a six pack of something
And a few dollars worth of gasoline

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe youd feel like taking a drive
Cause I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Oh Ive heard that its perfect
So what do you say we see if theyre right
Well I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe youd feel like taking a drive
Cause I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Theres a place that they call Heaven
Just south of town way up on a hill
They say you can see for miles
And when the sun goes down time stands still

Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin up red dust
Pickin us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA no AC in the vents

We were Jesus saved me blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin front seat leanin
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin up in little pink houses
Makin out on living room couches
Blowin that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but were all alright

Baptist church parkin lot tryin not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin it to second base but sayin you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sisters got a boyfriend Daddy doesnt like
Now hes sittin out back  in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

We were Jesus saved me blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin front seat leanin
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin up in little pink houses
Makin out on living room couches
Blowin that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but were all alright

Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldnt help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to Keep On Rocking Me Baby
Frat parties college bars just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldnt help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew preacher and a choir
Singing bout God brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now Only The Good Die Young stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine
I go back I go back
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back I go back
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back I go back I go back
Yeah I think Im gonna leave
Ill just have that one drink
And weve all gotta be up early
Boys we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

Aw naw somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron hang on
I just might have to stay hey
Aw naw look at the time yall
What happened to coats on long gone
I should be halfway home but aw naw

Yeah girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah I got my boys with me
Were just blowing off steam
Not looking to pick up anybody
So I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw Naw do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on cmon
DJ what you tryin to do
Aw Naw itll be so wrong
If we didnt dance one show off
Those jeans you painted on
Aw naw aw naw

No I didnt mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave so it aint my fault
No I didnt mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I supposed to do

Aw naw somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on weve been here all night long
Aw Naw it would be so wrong
If we didnt dance one more song show off
Those jeans you painted on aw naw
Yeah aw naw
Those jeans you painted on aw naw
Stressed out running late racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans
Its work work pay the rent money and my times spent
Not a minute left for me to be me
Been going like nothing can wait
I got to get my priorities straight

I need to live a little have some fun
Take some time waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little love a lot

Friday night here we go do a little dosido
Kick back have a laugh catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down there she is think I found
Maybe Ms Wonderful I havent met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
Shes giving me a wake up call

I need to live a little have some fun
Take some time waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little love a lot

Step back smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug unwind
Step out in the sunshine

I need to live a little have some fun
Take some time waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little
I need to live a little have some fun
Take some time waste it on number one
Take the girl get a map and pick any old dot
Live a little we need to live a little love a lot
If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then well kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you wanna then were gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then well let our feet hang off a fishin dock

It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go if we
Cleaned it up and got it running
Daddys old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it
To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Like a storm time rolls on
You cant hit pause thats just the deal
Most days in life dont stand out
But lifes about those days that we all like
Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
til the Alabama sun was breaking
Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind
Tonight Im in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Talladega
Talladega

High beams cutting a trail through the hay fields
Crossing the creek where the fuzz cant go

Words I wished Id said come on the radio

Ooh oh oh I know youre with someone else

But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin hard steamin up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

Where I once held you and its breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made wont fill this empty space

Ooh oh oh I know youre never coming back

But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow

Just close my eyes
I dont know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I dont mean to bother you but
I couldnt just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And youre not looking for anything right now
So I dont wanna come on strong
Dont get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
Its just a conversation
No girl Im not wasted
You dont know me
I dont know you but I want to

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I dont wanna wreck your Friday
I aint gonna waste my lines
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know youre try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And Im sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause shes supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
Its the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You couldve rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Couldve walked away
But youre still here
And Im still here
Come on lets see where it goes

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I dont have to meet your mother
We dont have to cross that line
I dont wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I dont wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I dont wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No I aint gotta call you baby
And I aint gotta call you mine
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
Im gonna be here for you baby
Ill be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than its ever been

And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us

Well follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And therell be a new day
Coming your way

Im gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
Youve been stretched to the limits but its alright now
And Im gonna make you a promise
If theres life after this
Im gonna be there to meet you with a warm wet kiss
Yes I am

And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us
And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us oh baby
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
Theres pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
Ill never get over you walking away

Ive never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your selfcontrol
But Im just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
All By Myself would sure hit me hard now that youre gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
Its going to hurt bad before it gets better
But Ill never get over you by hiding this way

Ive never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your selfcontrol
But Im just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
Ive never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your selfcontrol
But Im just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Im changing lanes and talking on the phone
Im driving way too fast
And the interstates jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
Were coming undone

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by oh ooh ooh

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
Were losing ourselves

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by oh ooh ooh
Yeah the days go by oh ooh ooh

We think about tomorrow then it slips away
Oh yes it does
We talk about forever but weve only got today

And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
Its all weve been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now

Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by oh ooh ooh
Yeah cause days go by oh ooh ooh

Oh so take them by the hand
Theyre yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Dont let them all fly by
Come on come on now
Yeah come on oh ooh ooh
Dont you know the days go by
Well I know theres a reason
And I know theres a rhyme
We were meant to be together
Thats why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say its forever
You understand

That youre always in my heart
Youre always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind
And theres no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone to another place
Then Id of never had this feeling
That I feel today yeah

And youre always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind
And theres no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way
Oh

And youre always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind
And theres no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

Only you can love me this way
Another long summers come and gone
I dont know why it always ends this way
The boardwalks quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
Were spinning around and youre holding on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you promised youd be back again
And so I wander round this town
til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears fix the lights tighten bolts straighten the tracks
And I count the days tell you just might come back

But then I close my eyes and one more time
Were spinning around and youre holding on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you swore that youd be back again
And so Im frozen in this town
Till summer comes around

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl if only for a moment
And Baby Ill be back again you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
til summer comes around
Well here you come again and youre looking so fine
You dont notice me but its alright
Im just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words its true
But its still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody I got to set you into a groove

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play repeat how happy Id be
Wherever Id go Id have you there with me
Youd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song oh oh oh

Well Id sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
Itd be so easy Id just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so youll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because youre already there anyway yes you are

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl
If I could press play repeat how happy Id be
Wherever Id go Id have you there with me
Youd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song

And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street theyll say
Hey arent you the girl in that song


I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out
Im in love with this girl
Yeah if I could press play rewind a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that youre all mine
Every night Id drive you home
If I could put you in a
Let me put you in a song
Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby
Last night I fell asleep and I saw you dancing in my dreams
Just like the way the Autumn leaves fall for you
All for you
You changed my life you changed my ways
I dont even recognize myself these days
It must be a reflection of you
Only you

I cant remember feeling love like this in so long
I cant imagine living life without you by my side
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry
Its so true Im all for you

My arms could hold you tight keep you warm in the coldest night
My hand would pull your hair right back away from your eyes
For you Only you
If I knew how to do it
Id paint the moon the stars around you
Paint the perfect sunset
But I couldnt make it more beautiful than you
Oh nothing compares to you
You know its true

I cant remember feeling love like this in so long
I cant imagine living life without you by my side
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry
Its so true Im all for you
I cant remember feeling love like this in so long
I cant imagine living life without you by my side
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry
Its so true Im all for you

Some might call it insanity
Without a doubt for the rest of my life
Im going to be crazy
Baby crazy for you
All for you
Im all for you
If theres sand that you aint wrote your name in
If youre tired of the view from the same window
If theres lips that you wanna be drunk on
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on go
See everything you think you need to see
Then come back to me
If theres pavement you aint put your shoes on
If theres dance floors you aint made a move on yet
And if youre feelin too safe here beside me
And you wanna do something you might regret
Try the whole world on if you feel the need
Then come back to me

I wouldnt want you to miss a thing
I wouldnt wake you from any dream youve ever had
So go on and go unroll every map
If you gotta leave you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
If theres greener grass
Hey i wanna hold you I dont want to hold you back

If you fly like a bird in the jet stream
Hope the sky is in Hollywoodsetscene blue
And if you land with a tan and your shades on
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true
But if aint all that you dreamed itd be
Come back to me

I wouldnt want you to miss a thing
I wouldnt wake you from any dream youve ever had
So go on and go unroll every map
If you gotta leave you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
If theres greener grass
Hey i wanna hold you I dont want to hold you back

If you find someone else who deserves you
Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you
But if he does you know right where Ill be
Come back to me
I picked up the phone
She said hey its me
I know it feels like forever
Since Ive heard your voice
But I guess thats how it had to be
So we talked awhile
Still she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
Theres something you need to know

I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though Im moving on
It dont mean that I dont still love you
Youll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life Ive begun
I found someone

Well I wasnt surprised
Still it hit me kind of hard
Its hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said Im happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since youve been gone
Ive done some praying
Some searching for myself

And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though Im moving on
It dont mean that I dont still love you
Youll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life Ive begun
I found someone

But it took tears and time down on my knees
And its not who youd ever guess
Or who I dreamed itd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

I found someone
Just happened out of the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But youll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life Ive begun
Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone
Dont worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if youre lying
If you really dont mean it I dont care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby Im buying

Well couldnt you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my tshirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Say you do

Yeah baby Im begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then dont call me
I dont mind a little smoke getting in my eyes
Baby take your hands take your lies
And lay em on me

Well couldnt you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my tshirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Say you do

Well dont worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if youre lying

Well couldnt you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my tshirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you dont
Couldnt you
Say you do
Say you do
Just say you do



















When you can look at her picture
And not want to kiss her no more
When you dont feel like youve been hit by a train
At the sound of someone saying her name any more
When you can drive down the road
And not be afraid of whats playing on the radio

Thats when you know its over
Thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
Thats when you know its over

When the time of the year
Dont stir up the tears any more
When it dont feel like the past is a gun
And theres nowhere to run any more
When it dont take every bone
To not dial her number just leave her alone

Thats when you know its over
Thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
Thats when you know its over

When you wouldnt go back even if you could
When hearing shes happy finally feels good

Thats when you know its over
Thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
Thats when you know its over
Thats when you know its over

Tryin to jump up out of your chest

Baby youre now on fire girl youre on fire
Out in the dark wrapped up in the stars

You and me wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
Theres a feeling in your eyes the shadows cant erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head

And Im on fire girl youre on fire
Out in the dark wrapped up in the stars

Say my name and watch me goin up in flames

Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down

Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
I never thought youd pick up the phone
Its Friday night you should be out on the town
Didnt think youd be sittin at home all alone like me
Nothin on TV nothin to do
Nothin to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

We dont have to be lonely tonight
I need you want you Im right here
We dont have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldnt but I dont care

I just wanna hold you till the heartbreaks gone
When the sun comes up we can both move on

Those kiss me eyes your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

Ohh its you girl
I never liked the taste of whiskey til I kissed it off of her lips
Never knew just what was hitting me getting me tipsy
But there I sit Levis on a dogwood branch
Yeah she was taking me under
I might have lost my innocence
But she was saving my soul that summer

I dont know much about eternity
Or where somebody like mes gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night shooting star paradise
Might be all that Im getting
Kissing and sipping that sevenohseven
Somewhere just south of heaven

She might have been a falling angel
Nah I didnt care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
Thats the way I could spend forever

I dont know much about eternity
Or where somebody like mes gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night shooting star paradise
Might be all that Im getting
Kissing and sipping that sevenohseven
Somewhere just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If theres a heaven on Earth man thatd be mine

I dont know much about eternity
Or where somebody like mes gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night shooting star paradise
Might be all that Im getting
Kissing and sipping that sevenohseven
Somewhere just south of heaven
Oh yeah just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If theres a heaven on Earth man thatd be mine
Yeah thatd be mine
Oh just a little bit south of heaven
Kick those high heels off like you hate them
Fill that glass of Cab up to the top
Let your mind unwind with every kiss I give
Lay your head down on this bed and Ill do the rest

Save your breath girl youre gonna need em
Slide out of them jeans baby nice and slow
You can hold on to your words like theyre a secret
Baby save your breath

Girl lets let our bodies do the talking
Yeah I know they got a lot to say
Ah but baby words wont ever make you feel this way

Save your breath girl youre gonna need em
Slide out of them jeans baby nice and slow
You can hold on to your words like theyre a secret
Baby save your breath
Baby save your breath

Save your breath girl youre gonna need em
Slide out of them jeans baby nice and slow
You can hold on to your words like theyre a secret
Baby save your breath
Baby save your breath yeah yeah yeah
Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town another damned old rodeo
I know this life is crazy
But Ill be home soon baby
Ill ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like Im here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I cant stay long
You wake up Ill be gone
Until then Ill hold on
Like a cowboy
I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I cant give it up like I said I would
I know its hard on you
But like I always do
Ill ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like Im here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I cant stay long
You wake up Ill be gone
Until then Ill hold on
Like a cowboy
Ill ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like Im here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
I got a picture painted in my mind
Looks like a field filled up with headlights
You add a little heat of July a little taste of the radio
Baby I could take you there if you wanna go

Whats your Friday night looking like
Whats a girl like you got on her mind
Whatever you wanna do Im down with you
Whats your Friday night looking like
Mine looks like you

What gets you off What gets you going
You tell me everything girl I gotta know it
Is it a longstem martini glass filled up to the top
Going faster than you wanna go
Saying baby dont stop no baby dont stop

Whats your Friday night looking like
Whats a girl like you got on her mind
Whatever you wanna do Im down with you
Whats your Friday night looking like
Mine looks like you

Girl I wanna know
Girl I gotta know

Whats a girl like you got on her mind
Whatever you wanna do Im down with you

Theres a want and theres a need
Theres a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

Ive got boots and shes got wings
Im hell on wheels and shes heavenly
Id die for her and she lives for me
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
Shes sweet Im wild were dangerous
Cowboys and angels

Im not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
Shes sweet Im wild were dangerous
Cowboys and angels

Theres a want and theres a need
Theres a history between
Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels

Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine

Lonely eyes well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think youll see
Those lonely eyes dont have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let em go
From the little bit Ive seen
Theyre the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me make em stay

Lonely eyes well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think youll see
Those lonely eyes dont have to be alone tonight

Lonely eyes

Cheers to a good country song

What do you say dude You down
Hell yeah count me in for that man
We met down at the floating dock
She snuck out scared she might get caught
We were nervous but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in she said Id better go
She took my tshirt and wore it home
A memory a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

We were too damn young to know any better

It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl
And she was birddogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her straight in the eye

It was a spring breakup
Baby dont cry
You arent from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now its a spring breakup
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

No I dont need your number
Dont want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to you
But you wont ever see me again
If Im a bad guy well I dont mean to be
But theres a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me

Spring breakup
Baby dont cry
You arent from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now its a spring breakup
Baby bye bye

Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that old beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it dont take you long to get over this

Spring breakup

I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time

Theres a Bible on the dash a little too good at collecting dust
Theres a shotgun on the rack and that rearviews got a picture of us
That radio dial stays on  cause its the only one around here that plays country
If ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
Its sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents got some dings been my best friend since I was 
Baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know wanna know what Im made of just look at my truck
That headlights still busted out from the night they tried to take my keys
And that tailgates all rusted now but you wouldnt believe the good times its seen
And when the girls would come and it can haul some ass
Youd never seen an  hit a hundred that fast
If ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
Its sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents got some dings been my best friend since I was 
Baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know wanna know what Im made of just look at my truck
Yeah plenty of stop sign birds on the power line shot in the daylight on county road 
Plenty of full moons plenty of me and you plenty of memories in the rearview
If ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
Its sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents got some dings been my best friend since I was 
Baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know wanna know what Im made of
I said if ya wanna know wanna know what Im made of just look at my truck
Aw yeah just look at my truck
Go on and look at my truck
Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom
Red sky faded to black
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didnt care if we were spinnin wheels
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Yeaahee
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Goin nowhere fast
I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica shes a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and shell get the last
Shes got the future I got the past
I got the class ring she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy and she got the man

Yeah theres an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now youre cleaned up with a hair cut nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice which would I choose

I got the first kiss and shell get the last
Shes got the future I got the past
I got the class ring she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the first kiss and shell get the last
We each got something the other will never have
I got the long hair hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man
I never thought youd pick up the phone
Its Friday night you should be out on the town
Didnt think youd be sittin at home all alone like me
Nothin on TV nothin to do
Nothin to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

We dont have to be lonely tonight
I need you want you Im right here
We dont have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldnt but I dont care
I dont wanna be right I dont wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreaks gone
When the sun comes up we can both move on
But we dont have to be lonely tonight

That taste that touch the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

We dont have to be lonely tonight
I need you want you Im right here
We dont have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldnt but I dont care

I can be there in five
One more one last time

We dont have to be lonely tonight
Oh I need you and Im right here
We dont have to be lonely tonight tonight tonight
Yeah yeah
If I could be the reason your hairs a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then Id be what you mean to me

Standing here watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

And oh all of this talking makes you laugh
But Ive gotta let you know
Just how I feel while im

Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low dancing slow
Oh if fallings how you feel
And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me

And perfects what you see
Then Id be what you mean to me

She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
Shes cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
Shes like a Sunday morning
Im a dancehall Saturday night
Shes like a stain glass window
Im a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
Theres something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
Shes always lookin so fine
That I cant believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girls off the hook
When shes good shes good
But even better when she gets that look

She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
Shes like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when Im feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul


Slow dancin
Romancin
Shes up to something
Wearin nothin but her beautiful smile
Shes up to something
Wearin nothin but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
Shes always lookin so fine
That I cant believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girls off the hook
When shes good shes good
But even better when she gets that look
When shes good shes good
But even better when she gets that look
Theres something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
Shes like a Sunday morning

To hide the kind of games youre tryna play

You hear a new song its your favorite
But pretty soon youll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than youre over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shines gone
Like you always do but you dont know it yet but

Woah woah
I aint gonna be that easy to leave
Woah woah
Girl Im gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
When your phone rings after midnight and youre thinking maybe its me
Gonna make you miss me

Youre cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think its easy but thats a lie
The only reason that youre good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met was too easy to forget
Well I aint going out like that

Woah woah
I aint gonna be that easy to leave
Woah woah
Girl Im gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
When your phone rings after midnight and youre thinking maybe its me
Gonna make you miss me
Woah woah
I aint gonna be that easy to leave
Woah woah
Girl Im gonna make you miss me

Writing letters that youre never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
Cause you cant fall asleep and youre wishing you were with me
Im gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When youre dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
Ill say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me

Gonna make you miss me
Im gonna make you miss me
And oh oh oh
Im gonna make you miss me
I knew Id see her around
Id be at some party shed show up and Id be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
Id look up shed be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
Id act like I didnt see her
Wed pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and Id get on with mine
Thought I would be fine heh but maybe not
I knew shed find a way to get over me
But Id never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess thats just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they dont want me to know
So they give me the goaround
But theres only so many streets so many lights
I swear its like I cant even leave my house
I shouldve known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it lowkey
But now its like these county lines are closing in on me
I see em everywhere together
And its hitting a little too close to home
Shes so far gone but she didnt go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
Shes leaving those same marks in someone elses yard
In someone elses arms right down the road
And I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess thats just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they dont want me to know
So they give me the goaround
But theres only so many streets so many lights
I swear its like I cant even leave my house
I shouldve known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say  that guy but I cant
Its my fault I let her go
I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess thats just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
They dont want me to know
So they give me the goaround
But theres only so many streets so many lights
I swear its like I cant even leave my house
I shouldve known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
Baby it was just one night
One kinda just like this
Maybe it was just one song
But one I wont ever forget
And maybe it was just one dance
Out on the beach bar floor
I had you there in my hands
But let you slip out that door

And girl I dont even know how to act now
You can put all them other girls in the background
I can only picture you
A couple seconds felt more like an hour or two
And I was all right thought I was on to the next one
I dont know why I cant forget one
Little taste of your lips
Well come on baby tell me tell me what you put in that kiss
That got me all tore up like this
A little summertime tease with a twist
Never knew how much Id miss that kiss

And that pretty little small town smile
That you put right there on mine
Now I aint got your number to dial
Or Id be callin you every night
Yeah your friends came runnin up
And you told me that you had to leave
Girl you left me here with half a beer
In the middle of a memory
Woahohoh

Girl I dont even know how to act now
You can put all them other girls in the background
I can only picture you
A couple seconds felt more like an hour or two
And I was all right thought I was on to the next one
I dont know why I cant forget one
Little taste of your lips
Well come on baby tell me tell me what you put in that kiss
That got me all tore up like this
A little summertime tease with a twist
Never knew how much Id miss that kiss

Baby it was just one night
One just like this
No I aint ever been right
Ever since that kiss yeah

Girl I dont even know how to act now
You can put all them other girls in the background
I can only picture you
A couple seconds felt more like an hour or two
And it was all right thought I was on to the next one
I dont know why I cant forget one
Little taste of your lips
Well come on baby tell me tell me what you put in that kiss
That got me all tore up like this
A little summertime tease with a twist
Never knew how much Id miss that kiss
Girl I dont even know how to act now
Yeah you can put all them other girls in the background
Come on baby
Tell me what you put in that kiss
Its been a real good run
Playin out here in the sun
Year after year beer after beer
Ive watched this crowd grow
I swear you all dont know
What you mean to me
Its been something to see
I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that its over
It makes me want to spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
Im about to spring break down

Next year Ill go through pictures
Wishin I was down there with ya
Hanging out itll kill me then
But Im here right now
So lets raise up our cups
Cant throw em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
Im about to spring break down

We made this sun tan city
And all of yall sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
You all do not know if might sound crazy
But you gonna make my spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
Ooobut the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
Im about to spring break down
Swear Im about to spring break down

Yall up there on them shoulders
Good and bad hangovers
Im about to spring break down
You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
And you act like you never saw me
When youre dancing with him and youre looking at me
Or Im holding her and Im hoping you see
Or the one where you dont kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games we play
I cant even keep em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place yeah
I cant tell if Im winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didnt know Id be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

All of these games we play
I cant even keep em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place yeah
I cant tell if Im winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

This breakup makeuphot and cold thing got me dizzy
You dont want me til I got somebody with me
Its gonna kill me
Baby tell me
What am I supposed to do with you

And all of these games we play
I cant even keep em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place yeah
I cant tell if Im winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games
Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn yall dont understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet or in her high heels
No matter how she moving its all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Dont nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Years Eve
Love it when shes locked on me

She get me high she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet or in her high heels
No matter how she moving its all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

She said Boy its time to take me home
Dont even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the pool and moonshine
You bout to be all mine

She get me high she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet in her high heels
No matter how she moving its all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Clouds roll by
She get me high
My shoulder still burns
My head still hurts
Theres sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on my straw youre crying out
I paint it in my rear view
My speaker still blasts that song
That you turn me on to

Its like that blue water ran up the highway
The salt air is pulling on my tailgate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights the cars the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home

Still hear your words saying we cant do this
Cause youre up there and Im down here
Baby lets go on and face it

Its like that blue water ran up the highway
Its so intense its blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights the cars the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home
I left the lights the cars the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
Is like we never even say good bye
It dont feel like you are really gone
You and the beach follow me home
Where you been hiding all week girl
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar in every place
Somehow I miss your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

Yeah in the morning Ill be gone gone gone
Oh baby thats just wrong wrong wrong

Before the week wed had you and me
Being drunk tangled up waking up
No we wouldnt be done

Every night another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down son

Aint no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains youre gonna get wet
But that old  aint let me down yet

Its a cutout picture of the s
When everything felt so free

Its yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for  years young
Ten sets of tires a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
Its three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol Bronco

I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times its in the beach bar parking lot

No it aint hard to pick me out
Cause its the only one in this town

Its yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for  years young
Ten sets of tires a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
Its three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I aint gonna ever let her go
My ol Bronco

Yeah its yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for  years young
Ten sets of tires a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
Its three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I aint gonna ever let her go
My ol Bronco
My ol Bronco
Real sad story here yall
Come on

I pulled her into my ride
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun maybe some quality time
Weve had a rocky year
She wasnt ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning off my credit card
She was burning cars out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didnt like the Spring Break side of me
Now Im rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

Oh well looks like Ive done it again
I ruined another one off
Maybe Im better off a single man
At least down here Panama City
Now that Im free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever yall need yeah its on me
So heres to me doing whatever the hell I want

Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didnt like the Spring Break side of me
Now Im rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Yall drink one with me
Oh cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess I cant control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need
Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes Ive lost the sand I brought to the beach
Its the way that you move when a song plays
That smile when you brush your hair away
The things that you do when you dont say
Keep working on me
Its the way that you walk when you walk by
The way that you come off a little shy
The way youre all up in my mind
Where you oughta be and it just keeps

Working on me dont know if you know it
Everything you do just gets me going
Baby youre driving me crazy
You got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time youre doin whatever
Youre doing to me
Girl cant you see
Its working on me

All that it takes is a little touch
There you go making my heart rush
Its got to be more than a little crush
When I can barely breathe
You better believe

Its working on me dont know if you know it
Everything you do just gets me going
Baby youre driving me crazy
You got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time your doin whatever
Youre doing to me
Girl cant you see its working on me

Look what you done now
Cant go back
To far gone now
Keep it coming
Cause girl I just cant get enough cant get enough

Yeah you got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time youre doin whatever
Youre doing to me
Girl cant you see
Its working on me

Keep on working on me
Me and my buddies grew up on the farm
Cant say much when youre working that hard
Just too tired to talk when the day is through
Aint never been much for writing love letters
A bunch of wildflowers seem to say it much better
So if youre gonna ask me how I feel about me and you

Yeah we ride like a Cadillac
Run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
We tied tighter than a rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got
Is that I like you a lot
I like you a lot a whole lot

Well I hope you are happy I finally said it
It took me awhile so dont you forget it
Ive always heard dont fix it if it aint broke
So if you aint doing nothin later at 
Come over take a ride in the CJ
Ill take you places honey you aint been before

Yeah we ride like a Cadillac
Run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
We tied tighter than a rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got
Is that I like you a lot
Yeah I like you a lot a whole lot


Yeah we ride like a Cadillac
We run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
We tied tighter than a rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got
Is that I like you a lot
I like you a lot a whole lot
Yeah we ride like a Cadillac
Run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
Tied tighter than a rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got
Is that I like you a lot
Yeah I like you a lot a whole lot
Im going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know youre going to be there
Im going to have a couple drinks just to knock off the edge
Not too much dont want to make a fool of myself
I know youre going to be there I know youre going to be there

And Im going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way Im going to pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I aint into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know youre going to be there

You love the band thats playing you wouldnt miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing girl I know youre going to be there
Going to walk right by that table were you always like to sit
And when I run into you its going to be an accident
I know youre going to be there
Im going to act like it aint nothing but another Friday night
And youre just some old friend and Im doing just fine
Like Im only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know youre going to be there

And Im going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way Im going to pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I aint into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know youre gonna be there
I know youre gonna be there

Im going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see you I dont know what Ill do
We met down at the floating dock
She snuck out scared she might get caught
We were nervous but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in she said Id better go
She took my tshirt and wore it home
A memory a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I cant help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
Tshirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

We were too damn young to know any better
There aint enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there aint enough
Matches I can strike
To set afire the memory of you
Up goes down
Rights gone left me behind
Wheels spin round
Reverse stuck in my mind

There aint enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there aint enough
Bottles I could break
To make em feel as broken as I do

Stack up every barrel
Since the day it was made
Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
But there aint enough
Kisses from a stranger
On a long wild night to ever make it alright
If it aint you
In my arms in my bed
Yeah to hell with all the rest
Once youve had the best nothing else will do
Whats the use

There aint enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there aint enough
Bottles I could drink
To make em feel as empty as I do

With my mouth wide open
In a whiskey rain
I could stand there  hours a day

But there aint enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there aint enough
Bottles I could drink
To make em feel as empty as I do
No there aint enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
So forget you
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin by your place
Back makin the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks restaurants
And seein some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing but when I hear your name

I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And its the fifth of May and Im right there staring in your eyes
And nothings change and were still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And Im hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And thats all it takes and Im in that place
Every time I hear your name

Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks shed make a great wife
Dad says he thinks shes the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But its way too soon to be talking bout rings
Dont wanna rush into anything
Shes getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an smile
Cause I know exactly what shes goin through
Yeah Ive been there too
And when the conversation turns to you

I get caught in a you were the only one for me
Kinda thought and your face is all that I see
I know I cant go back when I still go back
And there we are a point down by the riverside
And Im in your arms about to make love for the first time
And thats all it takes and Im in that place
Every time I hear your name

So Im thinkin bout the words I left unsaid
Every time I hear your name
Stop tryin to change the things I cant change
Every time I hear your name
In my heart I know youre gone but in my head

I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And its the fifth of May and Im right there staring in your eyes
Thats all it takes and Im in that place
And there we are a point down by the riverside
And Im in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I cant explain but Im in that place
Every time I hear your name

Every time I hear your name
Every time I hear your name
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Every time I hear your name
Ah ah every time I hear your name
Ive been a walking heartache
Ive made a mess of me
The person that Ive been lately
Arent who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you

Theres more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
Youll always be loves great martyr
And Ill be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you

On my own Im only
Half of what I could be
I cant do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you gave me you
He gave me you
Well that big red sun was sinkin slow
That rising had a haunting glow
I could see those heat waves rising off the ground
We were sittinon go at that old stop sign
Headlights shinin on the county line
It was do or die had to get out of that town
Well honey you said run
We were so young

Tryin to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl settin the world on fire

Yeah we were settin the world on fire
We were blazin down the road like Kerouac
No time to stop and cover our tracks
We were too damn hot for any one town to hold
Yeah we burned through a few good years
Then you started looking back in that rear view mirror
Right outside of Reno the trail got cold
You said youd had enough of this ramblin love

Tryin to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl settin the world on fire
Yeah we were settin the world on fire

Pullin on a lucky strike bout to head west
Ridin off into Gods sunset
Its times like this a always think of you
But honey you know me Ill always be

Tryin to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl settin the world on fire

Im settin the world on fire
Yeah Im settin the world on fire
I apologized when I picked her up
Said this old truck is just a fixer up
She smiled and said hey thats ok
Just a couple letters missing from the Chevrolet
I pulled out of her country club neighborhood
She was over there looking so damn good
And I was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks

But she took care of that when she pulled out that moon shine
Tasted like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho nuff messing me up
Till I couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
And that apple pie moonshine

We were dancing around in the high beams
Her hands in the back pockets of my jeans
The radio playing the perfect song
I still think about her every time the thing comes on
And I never forget that first kiss
When a country boy got to hold a real princess
I can still taste the cinnamon on her lips
Every time I reminisce

Its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho nuff messing me up
Till I couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time
Between her and that apple pie moonshine
Yeah I couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine
Caught up in a good time between her and that apple pie moonshine
Apple pie moonshine
Shes such a beautiful handful
Might be more than I can handle
Shes a wild child running down a Friday night
Got me wrapped around her finger and holding on tight
Shes so hot hey whats not to love
Heavens little devils got me all messed up
Shes a little heart breaker and Im her fool
Shes so hot its hard to be cool
Hard to be cool
Shes like a ten but better
She leads me on but I let her
Might be a spring fling heartache headed my way
And I may be crazy but all I can say is
Shes so hot hey whats not to love
Heavens little devils got me all messed up
Shes a little heart breaker and Im her fool
Shes so hot its hard to be cool
Hard to be cool
And I aint never seen anything like her
In that sexy little sundress man shes on fire
Shes so hot
Mmm yeah shes hot son
Shes so hot hey whats not to love
Heavens little devils got me all messed up
Shes a little heart breaker and Im her fool
Shes so hot its hard to be cool
Yeah its hard to be cool
Yeah its hard to be cool
Shes so hot
Whats up yall

Looks like were all riding on right here
Pass a beer
One more long day now on the coast
Is clear pass a beer

Wake up the guy on the radio
Says its time to get
We gotta go
We all got to do what we all got to do
To get to the part where we get the cut loose
Cut loose and hang where everybody is
On the lake where all them bikinis live
Where aint worries no bumers
Where our state of mind stays stuck on the summer


Hey everybody listen
Everybody out there anybody missin
I hold em up
Im on a mission
Heres to gettin passed being pushed to the brink
One two three everybody take a drink

Looks like theres a party up in here
Pass a beer
She looks hot but my vision aint too clear
Pass a beer

Oh pass a beer
Hook a brother up
Back in the trailer hook on a truck
Unload the boat and unlock the girls
Hey I dont know about the rest of the world but
Times are tough and times are strange
But times one thing that you cant change
Love is a noun and love is a verb
But sometimes love is a dirty word
It dont matter what tomorrow brings
Tonight you just need to think about one thing
And thats showing up and letting go
And maybe getting just a little out of control

And sing ohh
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
Thats all Im talking about

The sun will shine
And the clouds will rain
Might have to learn to smile through the pain
You lose a step but you gain a friend
Might even catch a break every now and then
So dont sweat it just let it slide
And when you get on the road baby let it ride
You gotta get up to get down
You gotta unwind a little to come on round

And sing ohh
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
Thats all Im talking about

Oh yeah yeah yeah

Im changing lanes and talking on the phone
Im driving way too fast
And the interstates jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
Were coming undone

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by oh ooh ooh

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
Were losing ourselves

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by oh ooh ooh
Yeah the days go by oh ooh ooh

We think about tomorrow then it slips away
Oh yes it does
We talk about forever but weve only got today

And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
Its all weve been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now

Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah its all weve been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by oh ooh ooh
Yeah cause days go by oh ooh ooh

Oh so take them by the hand
Theyre yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Dont let them all fly by
Come on come on now
Yeah come on oh ooh ooh
Dont you know the days go by
I had a hand me down ride painted rattle can red
Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning bout right by doin it wrong
Hopin we didnt get caught

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl go make the drag
If youre lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the H pageant
Seems like yesterday even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago

Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues bout

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl go make the drag
If youre lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the H pageant
Seems like yesterday even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl go make the drag
If youre lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the H pageant
Seems like yesterday even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Im driving home tonight catching all red lights
Thats alright cause I dont want to be alone
Theres nobody waitin there cold and empty bed
Words I wished Id said come on the radio

Ooh oh oh and I dont know why I do this to myself
Ooh oh oh I know youre with someone else

But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin hard steamin up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

So Ive been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and its breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made wont fill this empty space

Ooh oh oh and I dont know why I just cant let you go
Ooh oh oh I know youre never coming back

But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin hard steamin up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin hard steamin up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

Mmmm
If I could bring you back
Mmmm
Just close my eyes
Times are tough and times are strange
But times one thing that you cant change
Love is a noun and love is a verb
But sometimes love is a dirty word
It dont matter what tomorrow brings
Tonight you just need to think about one thing
And thats showing up and letting go
And maybe getting just a little out of control

And sing ohh
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
Thats all Im talking about

The sun will shine
And the clouds will rain
Might have to learn to smile through the pain
You lose a step but you gain a friend
Might even catch a break every now and then
So dont sweat it just let it slide
And when you get on the road baby let it ride
You gotta get up to get down
You gotta unwind a little to come on round

And sing ohh
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
Thats all Im talking about

And when you get tired of trying to be
Who they want you to be
Be what you wanna be
Well come on come on

And sing ohh
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out

And sing ohhh yeah
Dont you just wanna rock n roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night in the lights
Cuttin loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
Thats all Im talking about
Its one way in its one way out
Its one stop one cop one bar town
Where its eightball winner breaks
And the loser racks
Its the same old cars and the same old trucks
The same old coach with the same bad luck
But on Friday nights the home team side is packed
Its every reason that I left and every reason I go back

Yeah its the same old same old nothings changed
Where everybody knows your name
Its a dirt road trip down memory lane and old flame I cant get past
Yeah its every reason that I left and every reason I go back

Its the same old questions from my momas mouth
Its my dads voice Hey boy just wearing me out
About Yes sir yes maam
This is my house you dont talk back
Its the same cheap buddies with the same cheap beer
With the same cheap shots that I always fear
And them same old stories still get the same old laughs
Yeah its every reason that I left and every reason I go back

Oh I cant wait to get back
Shes as pretty as model on TV
You got to see her to believe me
That little lollipop will really make your jaw drop
You get to staring you cant stop

Sweet as a honey bee hive
She got my attention from the get go
She goes walking on by
Shes looking so fine
Shes a little piece of eye candy

When the good Lord made that little looker
He must of used a whole lot of sugar
Maybe thats the reason why I crave her
So much flavor all the time


She gets me higher than anything can
She melts my heart when shes holding my hand
Let me tell you something about her kisses
They aint nutritious but theyre delicious
If your looking for a woman thats a goddess or the hottest
Shes it


Eye candy
Yeah yeah yeah
Whoa
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark man is back in gear
Out on 
Man I can see the lights
Schools out and the nights roll in
Man just like a long lost friend
You aint seen in a while
And cant help but smile

And its two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a YooHoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause its one we know
Its a smile its a kiss
Its a sip of wine its summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
Its nice and cold
Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And its two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a YooHoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause its one we know
Its a smile its a kiss
Its a sip of wine its summertime
Sweet summertime

The more things change
The more they stay the same
Dont matter how old you are
When you know what Im talking bout
Yeah baby when you got

Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a YooHoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause its one we know
Its a smile its a kiss
Its a sip of wine its summertime
Sweet summertime
Staring out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
Im at these crossroads in my life
And I really dont know
Which way to go

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Maybe Ill settle down get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Down in Mexico
Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine

Lonely eyes well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think youll see
Those lonely eyes dont have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let em go
From the little bit Ive seen
Theyre the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me make em stay

Lonely eyes well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think youll see
Those lonely eyes dont have to be alone tonight

A Billy Graham fan like her mother
Wants her daddy and both brothers
To walk her down the aisle
She likes oysters raw for dinner
A little Wayne and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Keeps her tan lines in the winter

With those blue flame looks that you give me
You cant hide whats inside
And its killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

Every time we lie girl were losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone

Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters like lighters
Get a little higher get a little higher
Sippin on fire

Of everything youre feeling when were burning the midnight down again

Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty old truck
I dont know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

I said where I come from
Its cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said fingerlicking
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me
Howd I like my biscuit
Ill be honest with you maam
It aint like mama fixed it


I was chasing sun on 
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks maam back home
We like the girls that sing soprano


Well I was headed home on 
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
Thats rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Arent you from out in Tulsa
No but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa


Where I come from Its cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Where I come from
Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian oneman band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah thats what I see
When I see this bar

I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because its not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah thats what I see
When I see this bar

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah thats what I see
When I see this bar

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where theyve been
Or where they are
Yeah I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar

I wonder where we go from here
Thats what I see when I see this bar
Life isnt over but its always near
Thats what I see when I see this bar
I think about all the good times that we had
Thats what I see when I see this bar
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
Thats what I see when I see this bar
How could we be so close now so far apart
Thats what I see when I see this bar
Thats what I feel thats what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
Thats what I see when I see this bar

Thats what I see when I see this bar
Toes in the water with the river rollin
That little bit of butterfly tattoo showin
Nothin to do
Just let me fall in love with you
Aw long hair fallin on a sun tanned shoulder
Im wantin you bads about to take me over
And Im set on cruise
Just let me fall in love with you
Already got those crickets singin
Man you better go on and kiss her moonlight spotlight
Aint a chance in the world Ill miss it
Dont blink dont think dont move
Just let me fall in love with you
Just let me fall in love with you
Your skin wont stop feeling my fingers
I wanna wade in where the waters deeper
Nothin to lose
Just let me fall in love with you
Already got those crickets singin
Man you better go on and kiss her moonlight spotlight
Aint a chance in the world Ill miss it
Dont blink dont think dont move
Just let me fall in love with you
You dont get in the way of somethin
You cant slow down and you cant out run it
All I know is I feel it comin
Already got those crickets singin
Man you better go on and kiss her moonlight spotlight
Aint a chance in the world Ill miss it
Dont blink dont think dont move
Just let me fall in love with the
Already got those crickets singin
Man you better go on and kiss her moonlight spotlight
Aint a chance in the world Ill miss it
Dont blink dont think dont move
Just let me fall in love with you
Just let me fall in love with you
I cant slow down and I cant out run it
All I know is I feel it comin
Just let me fall in love with you
Country roads old theater marquee signs
Parking lots and billboards flying by
Spanish moss little hick town squares
Wild roses on a river bank
Girl its almost like youre there

Oh every mile a memory
Every song another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day a page turned down
Every night a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile a memory

Red sun down out across the western sky
Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seeing em with you baby
Oh they never do it right no

Eevery mile a memory
Every song another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day a page turned down
Every night a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile a memory

Funny how no matter where I run
Round every bend I only see
Just how far I havent come

Every mile a memory
Every song another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day a page turned down
Every night a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
And every mile a memory
Every mile a memory
Every mile a memory
So I guess its over baby
Dj vu again
Whod have thought that time dont stop
And somehow girl the world keeps spinning
I guess Ive turned myself into a solitary man
Aint like Im the only one
Thats in the shoes that I am

Do you hear that
Im right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
Its where Im at
Its the sound of teardrops falling down down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I dont like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys cant have all the luck
If others dont sing sad songs

Do you hear that
Im right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
Its where Im at
Its the sound of teardrops falling down down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Thats right
Another lover crash and burn

Do you hear that
Im right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
Its where Im at
Its the sound of teardrops falling down down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Pass the cotton fields and the old spring mill
We laid a blanket down where the world was still
Where nothing but a quarter of moon lights up the dark
Just me and her letting nature work
When it feels so right theres no need for work
All cuddled up just listening to our hearts
And the crickets itty bitty crickets
Aint another sound for miles around just listen
Its quiet real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord dont they say it all
It was going great just our third date
We were taking it slow but getting carried away
I never thought you could fall so far so soon
It could have been the rice or the Boones Farm wine
But either way my tongue came untied
We both heard me say I love you
Crickets nothing but crickets
Aint another sound for miles around just listen
Its quiet real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord dont they say it all
It might have been seconds but it felt like an hour
Then she gave me a kiss said its all worked out
Got my mamas white dress my grandmamas ring
I know a little church baby what do ya think
She said what do ya think
Its quiet ha ha real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord dont they say it all
Oh crickets itty bitty crickets
When the crickets start chirping lord dont they say it all
Do I pick you up
Do I meet you out
Are you a girl that stays home
Or do you like a big crowd
Its that midnight kiss
That knock my train off track
Well Ive been waiting on another one just like that
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms
Later on tonight
How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Well are you kinda like me
Sick and tired of this town
How bout we jump in my truck
And ride just around
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms
Later on tonight
How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Dont play hard to get
Girl it just aint fair
Dont you remember that night
There was magic in the air
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
Get you back in my arms

How bout a table for two
How bout a bottle of wine
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
On mine
Tell me what I gotta do
To get your smile on mine
You came along it was perfect timing for me
Yeah you dropped right in the puzzle like a missing piece
It took awhile for me to understand
You were the one I couldnt let slip through my hands
I remember when the lights came on
A blinding sun came shining on my world
Baby youre everything and more than everything I wanted
More than I deserve

A blinding sun came shinning on my world
Baby youre everything and more than everything I wanted
More than I deserve
Unthinkable undreamable unbelievable
Better than beautiful

You ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing
Like a broken record skipping down on main
Pretty girls pickups and cutoff jeans
You know what I mean
Dirt roads corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints jumping on the county line
Heard them sing about it a million times
But I dont mind

As long as theres a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie howl at the stars
Every time you hear that slide guitar
And your babys on the tailgate
And youre stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
Thats how we rock and thats how we roll
As long as theres country on the radio

Theres always going to be a party out in the pines
Always going to be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time
Theres always going to be people trying to run us down
Saying we arent got nothing on a big town
I bet theyd come around
If they came on down


Theres always going to be a part of me
Kicking back in BFE
Yeah thats how its always going to be


Some country on the radio
As long as theres a small town
Saturday nights
Blue jean babies
Yeah tip back your Dixie
Stealing those kisses
If it aint broke you can bet that Im gonna break it
If theres a wrong road Im damn sure gonna take it
Where theres smoke my pocket lighter sparked the fire
Where theres blue lights just read me my rights
No they dont make guys like me you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that aint gonna change
So take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim hell Im to blame
Where theres a love I tell ya girl I love to hate it
Where theres a do not touch my finger print done stained it
Where theres a train wreck sit on back and watch me crash
Where theres a what you say damn right I said it
No they dont make guys like me you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that aint gonna change
So take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim hell Im to blame
For breaking your heart taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud where theres a scar I carved it out
No they dont make guys like me you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that aint gonna change
So take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim hell Im to blame
I know where to aim hell Im to blame

Sand
We couldnt wait to get down on that beach
We had a football and some fake IDs
A place to crash a hundred feet from the sand
Mapco cooler and a radio
Natty Light and a pack of smokes
Yeah we were on a roll and
I keep Thinking bout bout it
Cant stop Thinking bout bout it

We had the world in the palm of our hands
Chasing the moon with aluminum cans
We lit it up blew it out
Yeah livin for the here and now
That summer slid by so fast
Like grains through an hour glass
Sand

I said hi to her on a double dare
We walked and talked and grew up underneath that pier
Then she disappeared and I keep Thinking bout bout it
I Cant stop Thinking bout bout it

We had the world in the palm of our hands
Chasing the moon with aluminum cans
We lit it up blew it out
Yeah livin for the here and now
That summer slid by so fast
Like grains through an hour glass
Sand
Sand

Every time I sink my feet in this white powder
I cant help but think about it and think about her

We had the world in the palm of our hands
Chasing the moon with aluminum cans
We lit it up blew it out
Yeah livin for the here and now
That summer slid by so fast
Like grains through an hour glass
Sand

Ohooh
Ohooh
Sand
Ohooh
Ohooh
I cant stop thinkin bout thinkin bout it
Ohooh
Ohooh
I keep thinkin bout thinking bout

It was Sunday afternoon
I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was on
Tampa Bay and Carolina
I wasnt payin much attention
The volume down not watchin it at all
This house was like an ice box
Had all the curtains drawn
I had it more like a hotel room and less like a home
Its been so quiet around here lately
I wasnt thinkin anyone would call

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know Id finally hit the bottom
An all time low
Suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought Id never find somebody new
Let alone you

Now here I am at the baggage claim
A nervous wreck waitin on your plane
Ring in my hands checking my watch
I never dreamed  hours ago
Id be standing here waitin on anyone
No not anyone

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know Id finally hit the bottom
An all time low
Suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought Id never find somebody new
Let alone you
Let alone you
You got a Daytona gold tan skin like the soft sand
Girl youre as cool as the blue on a cold can
Little bit of wild child coming through that tipsy smile
With you wearing whatever the hell you want kind of style
The kind of naughty habit I could get used to heh

You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
Im as gone as Ive ever been and it aint weed or whiskey baby
You put your hands on me Ill put my hands on you
Well get out of hand girl Ill give you whatever hand you want me to
I cant quit cant kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy

Hint of a lime twist cinnamon lipstick
Youre dropping hips give a glimpse of your secret
Starts with just a kiss then well take innocence
Put it in the rear view and haul ass straight for sin

You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
Im as gone as Ive ever been and it aint weed or whiskey baby
You put your hands on me Ill put my hands on you
Well get out of hand girl Ill give you whatever hand you want me to
I cant quit cant kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy

Girl I lose my mind
A little more every time
Ive been racing cross the line
Let me make your body unwind

You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
Im as gone as Ive ever been and it aint weed or whiskey baby
You put your hands on me Ill put my hands on you
Well get out of hand girl Ill give you whatever hand you want me to
I cant quit cant kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy
Fifty shades of crazy

You put your hands on me Ill put my hands on you
Well get out of hand girl Ill give you whatever hand you want me to
I cant quit cant kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy
Thought it was safe to go outside
But I guess I was wrong
Thought I could take a little ride
Just to see what was going on
Girl I know its been a while
A while since youve been gone I swear
Oh but baby I still see you everywhere

Around every corner cafe back road stop sign
Stoplight streetlight glowing
Around every highway driveway fast song slow song
On my radio
At every party dive bar backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down showdown oh now
Whyd you leave me living in a ghost town

Across the room I see your face
Then it disappears
I hear your voice call out my name
Whispering in my ear
I reach for you but youre not here
Youre still here

Around every corner cafe back road stop sign
Stoplight streetlight glowing
Around every highway driveway fast song slow song
On my radio
At every party dive bar backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down showdown oh now
Whyd you leave me living in a ghost town

Well I know you dont want me
So why oh why oh why do you haunt me

Around every corner cafe back road stop sign
Stoplight streetlight glowing
Around every highway driveway fast song slow song
On my radio
At every party dive bar backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down showdown oh now
Whyd you leave me living in a ghost town
Georgia backroad honeysuckle
Southwest Texas big belt buckle
West Virginia homemade whiskey
Send it on up to St Paul city
Float it back down the Mississippi
Doesnt matter where you are
Its the same old stripes
The same old stars
The same old highways cuttin across
The same old moon turnin on and off
Canned up Chevy at a traffic light
With a pretty girl on a Saturday night
And Willie Nelson singin On The Road again
Lookin around its good to see
Everybody out there keepin it country
Broadway Nashville Pedalsteal
LA lights on  wheels
Ride that sun across the sky
From Jackson Hole to Telluride
And get a little Rocky Mountain high
Doesnt matter where you are
Its the same old stripes
The same old stars
The same old highways cuttin across
The same old moon turnin on and off
Cammed up Chevy at a traffic light
With a pretty girl on a Saturday night
And Willie Nelson singin On The Road again
Lookin around its good to see everybody out there
Keepin it country
From muscle shows to Santa Rose
From Bakersfield to Tullahoma
From Baton Rouge up to Buffalo
Anywhere that you might call home
Doesnt matter where you are
Its the same old stripes
The same old stars
The same old highways cuttin across
The same old moon turnin on and off
Cammed up Chevy at a traffic light
With a pretty girl on a Saturday night
And Willie Nelson singin On The Road again

Smoking back roads like a bonfire
Bare foot on the gas ball cap on the dash
Windows down little town blowing right past

Its been forever since Ive seen a hook sink
I got a pole in a box up in the back seat
And Ill be taking the long way to the lake
And if I gotta go slow its better that way
Country roads bumping like the stereo

A little mud on the windshield
A little sun on my skin
Six pack in the seat nobody but me
Feels good to be rolling around again

Yeah you know its on know its on

Show you a side of these two lanes youve never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight Im bout to show you one hell of a night

So give me that aw yeah and take me there look
Im a sucker for your kiss wanna steal em from your lips baby like a truck
Foot heavy on the floorboard everywhere we go
Im talking once in a lifetime blowing your mind
Burning down these back roads

Show you a side of these two lanes youve never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight Im bout to show you one hell of a night


So give me that aw yeah and Ill give you that all night
Girl give me that lets go and Ill give you that good good time

Show you a side of these two lanes youve never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight Im bout to show you one hell of a night

Yeah a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl looking down the ride of one hell of a night
Im bout to show you one hell of a night
Laying back against this windshield
Parked out in this Georgia red field
This is where we burn our summer nights
Moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that Tacoma
We were seventeen going on free and wild

She was smoking hot a whiskey shot a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

Im sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of Dixieland Delight
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But shell always float
Back through my mind like smoke

July flames October ashes
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
We never said goodbye we let it fly into thin air
Tonight Im stoned on longgone love so strong I swear

Im sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of Dixieland Delight
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But shell always float
Back through my mind like smoke

She was smoking hot a whiskey shot a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

Im sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of Dixieland Delight
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But shell always float
Back through my mind like smoke
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop s just whistling by
Steer the wheel one handed on a two lane hugging that line
I got the windows down no one else around singing

Oohoohooh
Freedom is the miles Im rolling on
Oohoohooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody like a radio dialing in strong
Come on come on sing along sing along to my backroad song
Oohoohooh
Oohoohooh
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay fields just been cut
I got the windows down way out of town singing

Oohoohooh
Freedom is the miles Im rolling on
Oohoohooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody like a radio dialing in strong
Cmon cmon sing along sing along to my backroad song
Oohoohooh
Oohoohooh
The only way today could get better girl what Im thinking
Is I can pick you up you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing
Oohoohooh
Let me hear you sing it
Oohoohooh

Oohoohooh
Freedom is the miles were rolling on
Oohoohooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody like a radio dialing in strong
Cmon cmon sing along sing along to my backroad song
Cmon cmon sing along sing along to my backroad song
This is my backroad song
Oohoohooh
Feel the rhythm of it feel the rhythm of it
This is my backroad song
Oohoohooh
Feel the rhythm of it feel the rhythm of it
Come on come on sing along
Oohoohooh
Feel the rhythm of it feel the rhythm of it
To my backroad song
Oohoohooh
Feel the rhythm of it feel the rhythm of it
Girl you shine like a brand new dime
Like a song in rhyme I can sing to
I bet them boy doll stand in line
So they can take you out and try to win you
My boots and jeans dont go so well
White table cloth in a Ritsy hotel
Im used to much simpler things
So baby climb on in this truck
Ill show you what I mean

I wanna love you on a Silverado bench seat
Fogging up the windows while were hard down by the creek
No other light but the stars and the moon
Thats what you get when this country boy loves you
A girl like you is just so pretty
Youve been wining down all over this town
I wanna take you far from the city
Back on up the back road and watch the sun go down

And well see around midnight if the sky is right
Have the water start dancing in the moonlight
If you want a country boy loving you
And girl I know you do
Im the one you can count on every night
Ill never do you wrong
Im halfway between the sunset and sunrise
Middle of dusk and dawn
I am the darkness the memory of light
The first thing tomorrow when you close your eyes
Ill find you anywhere you hide

I am the midnight
I am the lonely hearts over the searching souls
I am the whiskey sip you drink instead of going home
Im in a lovers rock Im in a dreamers pray
I am a little bit of hope when you need another day
Whoa tonight its a matter of time
I am the midnight
Im the song when you wont dance slow dance
On a Saturday night
Im the sleep that you need but you dont get
On a late night drive
I am the zeros on the clock
When a hard days done Ill be your rock
Some want me to go and some want me to stop

Im the beginning and end
Im full of crazy and sin
I see your timing again
I am the midnight
Im the lonely hearts over the searching souls
I am the whiskey sip you drink instead of going home
Im in a lovers rock Im in a dreamers pray
I am a little bit of hope when you need another day
I am the midnight
I am the lonely hearts over the searching souls
I am the whiskey sip you drink instead of going home
Im in a lovers rock Im in a dreamers pray
I am a little bit of hope when you need another day
Whoa tonight its a matter of time
I am the midnight
I am the midnight
I am the midnight
I am the midnight
Bet your windows rolled down and your hairs pulled back
And I bet you got no idea youre going way too fast
Youre trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop til you get where you goin
Youre trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway wont hold you tonight
The highway dont know youre alive
The highway dont care if youre all alone
But I do I do
The highway wont dry your tears
The highway dont need you here
The highway dont care if youre coming home
But I do I do

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah I bet youre bending Gods ear talking bout me
Youre trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
Youre trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway wont hold you tonight
The highway dont know youre alive
The highway dont care if youre all alone
But I do I do
The highway wont dry your tears
The highway dont need you here
The highway dont care if youre coming home
But I do I do

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without I cant live without you baby oh baby
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
My heart is beating you can feel it I can show you how
Theres so much tension not to mention girl youre staring me down
We dont ever have to leave this room
But if you really want to
Chorus
Baby come with me
Close your eyes theres no telling what well see
Let the world stay in mediocrity
Follow up baby come
Ill light a candle that can handle this shadowing room
So many things I can see why Im traveling here
Let the passion of the night control
Just where we wanna go

Everybody wants to get away
Run away out of town
Thats not to worry about
Me and you got a lot to do
Wrapped up in this blanket on the ground
Look at what youve found

Close your eyes theres no telling what well see
Let the world stay in mediocrity
Follow up baby come baby come
Im over the top I say what I think
I get out of head with too many drinks
I hate to be wrong when I know that I am
I need to be strong when sometimes I cant
And just when I think Im complicating things

She makes it so easy
She means it when she talks about love
It means so completely
She knows just who I am
Im the sinner shes grace
Im leather shes lace
We fit perfectly
She makes it so easy
To be me
Im strong in the head a dreamer in heart
I dont finish everything that I start
Im easily mad quick to the draw
Slow to give in when its all my fault
But shes on my side through all my stubborn pride

To be me
Its hard enough to give your heart to someone
Its hard enough to get back the same
Its hard enough to find your own angel
Its hard enough to make her stay
I guess I learned it from my granddad
I like the shirt with a little pearl snaps
Id die boots if it was up to me
And bury me in blue jeans
Couldnt be a cowboy Im a hundred years late
Im a six string poet and a radio slave
I never ask for too many things
Just bury me in blue jeans

And I know I know thats so far ago
Get the roots of an oak and tumbleweed soul
When my times up all this good ol boy needs
Is to bury me in blue jeans
Im a brother Im a son Im a dad
Im a thankful one for everything I have
Im not gonna regret the past
When they bury me in blue jeans

And I know I know thats so far to go
Get the roots of an oak and tumbleweed soul
When my times up all this good ol boy needs
Is to bury me in blue jeans
Something faded and worn in the knees
Fits like a glove and frayed at the seams
And throw this old guitar in there please
When you bury me in blue jeans
Please give me so far to go
Oh give me so far to go
If you can hear me now
Give me so far ago
Give me roots of an oak
I gotta turn these leaves soft
Far so far ago its so far ago
This aint no candlelight
Warm glass of wine night
Its more a whiskey water
Drink thats on the rocks kind
Lets crank the radio
Get this truck on into town
Somebody call the fire department
Were gonna burn it down
Girl I can see it in your eyes
I know youre feeling like getting wild

Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
Were gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah were gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatevers gonna get you feeling right
Girl were gonna find it tonight

You call your girlfriends up
And Ill call some boys of mine
I know the bouncer at the bar
No we dont stand in line
Ill hit the DJ with some money
Hell play all your songs
Were gonna get it right
Even if its all wrong
Girl I can see youre eyes
I know youre feeling like getting wild

Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
Were gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah were gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatevers gonna get you feeling right
Girl were gonna find it tonight

Girl I can see it in your eyes
Gonna have fun when we get home tonight

Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
Were gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah were gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatevers gonna get you feeling right
Girl were gonna find it tonight
Were gonna find it tonight
Yeah were gonna find it tonight
Whatevers gonna get you feeling right
Girl were gonna find it tonight
Five card with the fellas on a Friday night
One hit a little trip to get us feeling right
Boom boom coming hot out the tubes
Talking big game like us boys do
Then those hazel eyes fire the light
On the eye five now Im throwing deuces
Im gone fellas catch you on the flip side
They give me hell like what the hell
Man you always bounce with poor excuses
But Im out the door hauling ass to you and ninetyfive

I ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
Tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
Were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

Girl why you laughing Ive told this joke a thousand times
But dont you dare stop you know I love to hear your smile
Laying you down feels so right nothing better than you by my side
Yeah then you give me hell for a smell a high life on my breath
I say come on now you knew Id be right here
I was up a hundred bucks when you hit me with that text
Folded on a full house and threw my truck in fifth gear

I ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
Tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
Were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week
Yeah hanging with them is a damn good time
But its got nothing on what what Im seeing tonight
So I ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
Tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
Were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

And roll you like the Stones
Blow out them speakers in my old headphones
Gonna fly like an eagle
When I drop a needle in the groove alright

With a pop and a hiss and a little bit of static
Well be chillin like a villain on some Dylan
While were killin some brews alright
Were gonna kick it like the kids did in 

So itll just be me and you
Playing air drums with The Whos Keith Moon
You know them good ones always die too soon

Blow out them speakers in my old headphones

With a pop and a hiss and a little bit of static
Well be chillin like a villain on some Dylan
While were killin some brews alright
Lets kick it like the kids did in 
Yeah were gonna kick it like the kids did in 
I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
Id love to hear youre killing it dude yeah its been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess Ive been in a dry spell but thats about to change
Cause every week has a weekend by this time Friday night
Ill be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And Ill be crushin it yeah Ill be crushin it
They say your babys mad cause you told her that youd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
Youre up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head looks at you and says
Aint you good for anything and you say
Every week has a weekend by this time Friday night
You want a margarita Ill get Tequila and ice
And Ill be crushin it with a cold one in my other hand
Ill be crushin it when Im finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead yeah I got this
Ill be crushin it oh Ill be crushin it
I figured this out in college walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait Im the king of getting unwound
And every week has a weekend by this time Friday night
Ill be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And Ill be crushin it every weekends a weekend
Yeah Ill be crushin it by this time Friday night
Ill be crushin it Ill be done with my third can
Oh Ill be crushin it of cold Bud Light
Ill be crushin it Ill be crushin it
If money didnt matter Id buy a brand new Chevrolett
And I burt up the full tank on a sunset back road
If money didnt matter Id buy a house out on a lake
With a boat up going to think oh but deep down I know

Thats not like going home at night
Pulling in a dirt ol driveway
Falling in the arms of the girl I love
I know who I am Im a rich man
Every single day
Because if money didnt matter
It wouldnt matter anyway
If money didnt matter Id quit working it so hard
I smoke a bunch of sweet cigars on a chair out on the beach
If money didnt matter Id buy a seat on a big jet
See the places I havent yet but if you werent with me

We could still take a trip to the lake
Count the stars of my old town gate
Oh a billion bucks cant buy that kind of stuff
Cause you cant buy going home at night
Cause you cant buy going home at night
Pulling in a dirt ol driveway
Falling in the arms of the girl you love
I know who I am Im a rich man
Every single day
Because if money didnt matter
It wouldnt matter anyway
If money didnt matter
It wouldnt matter anyway
It wouldnt matter anyway
Uh if money didnt matter
It wouldnt matter anyway
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet theres nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he aint got nothing on you
I dont wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you oh

Its a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
Its way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when youre blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound I like the sound of that
I like the sound I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you yes I do

Its a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
Its way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when youre blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound I like the sound of that
I like the sound I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on baby turn down the lights
I aint going nowhere Im all yours tonight

Its a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
Its way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when youre blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound and I love the sound of that
I like the sound I like the sound of that

I like the sound I like the sound of that
Yes I do I like the sound I like the sound of that
Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like Im tipsy
And I aint even had a drink

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything youre doing to me right nows
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go come on
Baby let me hear you say oh oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything youre doing to me right nows
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go come on
Baby let me hear you say oh oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning
I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while

I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sitting so far back
Out in the country just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are

I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low


Just lay low slow it down
Girl lets go and get outta town
I wanna hear raindrops falling down

I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

Oh just lay low
Just lay low

A thousand sunburned souls
Rumrunners and cold Bud Light
A little Friday night summertime rock and roll
Packed in tight they were singin along
I was hanging on the edge of the crowd
When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around

Guitars on the Gulf breeze
Smoke rings round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No that aint what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air

That one look led to a walk on the beach
And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and downhome smile
Ive ever had these arms around
The ams were screamin and the people were too
While were slow dancing on our bare feet
Aint it funny how we missed it all
And still didnt miss a thing

Guitars on the Gulf breeze
Smoke rings round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No that aint what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air

The thought of you wont let me go
Its been holding on for years
It dont take much to take me back
Everytime I hear

Guitars on the Gulf breeze
Smoke rings round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No that aint what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air
Raise your lighters in the air
Crickets singin in the evening hours
Daddy on guitar pickin Wildwood Flower
Old record player spinnin LPs
Yeah thats music to me
Reel screamin large mouth on the line
Georgia breeze whistlin through the pines
Mama hollerin yall lets eat
Yeah thats music to me

Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
Thats who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now thats music to me
High school football when the home team scores
Little bare feet on a hardwood floor
Hearin her whisper the kids are asleep
Now thats music to me

Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
Thats who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now thats music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
Thats who I am and what I love
A ho down fiddle a little off key
Old hound dog ahowlin yeah thats music to me
Yeah thats music to me
Ragtop cruisin on a hot summer day
Windows rolled up with the AC cranked
Girl Im in heaven when youre here with me
Bare feet dancin in the passenger seat
But when its said and done wed have a lot more fun
In this kind of weather some things are just better
Topless
Go on and drop it
Come on sweet thing lets rock this
In the sunshine
No tan lines
Its the difference tween a good and a great time
You and me wild and free on a day just like this
Some things are better topless
You know I like you in that red sundress
Yeah I love what it does when it hugs your hips
Oh Im a sucker for those baby Ts
Aint fair how I stare makes me weak in the knees
But when its said and done wed have a lot more fun
In this kind of weather some things are just better
Topless
Go on and drop it
Come on sweet thing lets rock this
In the sunshine
No tan lines
Its the difference tween a good and a great time
You and me wild and free on a day just like this
Some things are better topless
Cooler full of beer just sittin right here
This is the perfect weather some things are just better
Topless
Go on and pop it
Come on sweet thing lets rock this
In the sunshine
No tan lines
Its the difference tween a good and a great time
You and me wild and free on a day just like this
Some things are better topless
Some things are better topless
You know I love you topless alright
Gonna hop on that train today
Ive got nowhere to go no reason to stay
In four years Ive traveled a hundred and sixty thousand miles
And the wind keeps pulling me out
Maybe I go cause Im chasing something
Maybe I go cause somethings chasing me
Maybe I leave cause Ive yet to find
Someone to look me in the face and say
Stick around
I want you next to me so stick around
There aint no reason for leaving
Yeah the roads been hard boy
But Ill never let you down
So come on stick around
Post cards and road maps
Empty alley ways cigarettes
Five miles to my next exit
And Ive been singing to a room of strangers
I miss my family I miss my brother
I wonder if his son is ever gonna know me
I wonder if Ill ever have a son that I could call my own
I wish someone will hold me down and say
Stick around at least occasionally
Stick around
There aint no reason for leaving
This lifes too good boy
And I think youre missing now
So come on stick around
Stick around
Im gonna hop on the train
Got nowhere to go no reason to stay
In four years Ive traveled a hundred and sixty thousand miles
Maybe one day maybe I will
Maybe I will maybe I will
Stick around
We gonna melt some ice
We gonna roll the dice
We gonna slip and slide into paradise
We gonna grind some gears
We gonna ring some ears
We gonna drink some beers
Til they disappear

Drink the good times down
Little buzz in a cup

It dont even matter
Long as that thing will float
Wish I had a boat

Bumping cans spilling tripping slipping and popping

These are the best beers
Man these are the best beers of our lives
We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And hed climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

We had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didnt really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

This old guitar taught me how to score right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you cant have
Sweatshirts and flag football spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all we never dreamed it wouldnt last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

We had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didnt really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

We all kind of went our separate ways but I swear it seems like yesterday

We had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didnt really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
Im a  spinning on an old Victrola
Im a twostrike swinger Im a Pepsi Cola
Im a blue jean quarterback saying I love you to the prom queen
In a Chevy
Im John Wayne Superman California
Im a Kris Kristofferson Sunday morning
Im a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

And Im a child of a backseat freedom baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden never grow up never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar John Deere John 

Hey hey
Everything I needed
Thats right

Im Mark Twain on the Mississippi
Im Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
Im a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
Im a Texaco star Im a Gibson guitar
Im still a teenage kid trying to go too far
Im a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

And Im a child of a backseat freedom baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden never grow up never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar John Deere John 

I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live the more I see it
Theres only one way home

And Im a child of a backseat freedom baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden never grow up never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar John Deere John 
Oh Im a child of a backseat freedom baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden never grow up never grow old never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar John Deere John 

John Cougar John Deere John 
Everything I needed
John Cougar John Deere John 
Everything I needed
John Cougar John Deere John 
Oh thats right
You put me on a roller coaster fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you I would never be the same
But I let you take me over girl so Im the one to blame

You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind

You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show that apple girl and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get outta this straight jacket

You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind

I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is Im locked in here with you
Im always watching you wondering what youll do next
But my favorite part about it is is I always have to guess
you know I do

You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Its no secret that lately there aint no escape
And that Ive been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you aint ever coming home
But today the tears aint gonna hit the floor
Cause the boats in the bay and its calling my name
So Im heading on out the door

Cause the suns too bright the skys too blue
Beers too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew Id been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days youre taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
Its a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

Cause the suns too bright the skys too blue
Beers too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah the musics too good my friends are all out
And theyre all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you Ive got nothing to say
Ill save it for a rainy day

Therell be plenty of time for what ifs and whys
And howd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

Cause the suns too bright the skys too blue
Beers too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah the musics too good my friends are all out
And theyre all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you Ive got nothing to say
Ill save it for a rainy day

Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that Ive had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin rain

And I know that I cant ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
Youre a saint youre a goddess the cutest the hottest a masterpiece
Its too good to be true nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

And I know that I cant ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah yeah
Mmm

I dont need no vacation no fancy destination
Baby youre my great escape
We could stay at home listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die I could die a happy man
Mmm
Hey girl wassup
I know its late but I knew youd pick it up
Naw I aint drunk
Okay maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say youre taken but I say
Girl youre takin too long

To tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Rip it off just like a BandAid
The way you look at me girl you cant pretend
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him

I know you dont wanna break his heart
But that aint no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look just tell him its you it aint him
And maybe you can lie to him and say youll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you aint in love
Cmon you cant deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Rip it off just like a BandAid
It aint my business to be all up in
But I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him break up with him

You wouldve hung up by now
If you werent thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

Id tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Just rip it off just like a BandAid
Yeah I know I said it but Ill say it again
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you cant pretend
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him
We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
Thats when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man aint this some shhhh

Your daddys gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldnt change one thing
Baby yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man they werent playin
They sure put those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk em
They didnt fall for it but I did
You were on the left I was on the right
I knew you didnt smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

I swear your daddys gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldnt change one thing
Baby yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

And you were like oh woah oh
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didnt mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

Cause there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
But you were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back the back the cop car

I fell in love in the back of a cop car cop car

Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

I said hey hey baby do you wanna come over
You say no way then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

Tshirt right there
Your hair messed up like a GunsNRoses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I aint ever seen anything like
Your dress my floor
The way you wore my my Tshirt
Yeah my tshirt
Oh yeah

We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying keep it down
But its hard to unlock the door
When youre making out
You know what Im saying
Youve been saying that weve gotta quit doin this
So why you leanin in for one more kiss
And pretty soon youre sliding off what youve got on
And slippin into my

Tshirt right there
Your hair messed up like a GunsNRoses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I aint ever seen anything like

Cause you sure look good in my tshirt
Oh no baby no I cant lie

The second she walked through the door I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the nights kind of blurry
Now the suns peeking through the shades
I cant help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy Im feeling so high high
Cause Im still drunk drunk on your love on your love

Its not in the whiskey tequila or the wine
Its all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy Im feeling so high high
Cause Im still drunk drunk on your love on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy Im feeling so high high
Cause Im still drunk drunk on your love on your love

Woke up still drunk on your love
On your love woke up still drunk on your love
On your love woke up still drunk on your love
On your love woke up still drunk on your love
woke up still drunk on your love
On your love on your love woke up still drunk on your love
On your love get drunk on your love yeah
Im so drunk
Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
Im rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when lifes a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But theres a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that wont let go
Im out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when lifes a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But theres a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when lifes a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But theres a crack in the reflection
Hope hes moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut you up
With my lips on your lips
Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hairs painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls oh
Hear what can start with a whisper
And what if that
Kitchen table gets wrecked
Yeah plates crashing down
With my breath on your neck
What if that 
You spent at the store
Takes the rest of the night off
As it slides to the floor
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hairs painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls oh
Hear what can start with a whisper
Oh with a whisper yeah
Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hairs painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls oh
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper yeah
With a whisper
Yeah hear what can start with a whisper
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Dont make a difference to me baby where the wind takes me long as Im with you girl

I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place

Meet my friends for a girls night out
Seems there aint much to talk about
Same drinks that were all raising
But all of the toasts just dont feel the same

We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now its like they dont know how to act
Maybe theyre like me and they want us back
Its like theres always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but its true
When they think of me they think of you

They keep asking how I am
But theyre really asking where youve been
I can read between all of the lines
It aint just us missing all of the times

We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now its like they dont know how to act
Maybe theyre like me and they want us back
Its like theres always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but its true
When they think of me they think of you

Aint it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa when they think of you
It can burn when its in the past

We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now its like they dont know how to act
Maybe theyre like me and they want us back
Its like theres always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but its true
When they think of me they think of you

Oh they think of you
When they think of me
Baby baby oh
When they think of me they think of you
Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time were together
Yeah thats my dilemma
I need more time with you
I wanna watch the sun
Rise through the pines with you

Night like this wouldnt wanna miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You could be the one I could get lucky with
If the boot fits

Woah diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah youre the kind of fine that I cant deny
It gets me high cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Yeah baby we can run away
My carriage is a x horse Chevrolet
Youre like a princess
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince
If the boot fits

Woah diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah youre the kind of fine that I cant deny
It gets me high cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Woah diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah youre the kind of fine that I cant deny

Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits
Woah if the boot fits

Since you turned the tables on me
Ive been steady and learnin lonely
Keepin this turntable spinnin
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin my survival
In a threefoot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
Ive been havin a record year

I bet you thought before you left
Id just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin slow in a livin hell
But loves got a funny way of keepin score
And your leavin lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon one scotch one beer
Im havin a record year

Quarter notes and Hanks half time
Are poundin on this heart of mine
Song to song I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your goodandgone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
Im either gonna get over you
Or Im gonna blow out my ears
Yeah youre out there now
Doin God knows how and Im stuck here
Havin a record year

Your leavin left me goin crazy
Im countin on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go round and round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hanks half time
Are poundin on this heart of mine
Song to song I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your goodandgone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
Im either gonna get over you
Or Im gonna blow out my ears
Yeah youre out there now
Doin God knows how and Im stuck here
Havin a record year
Yeah Im havin a record year
Its two tickets to a concert
Its a Daytona airbrush Tshirt
Wondering whos gonna kiss you first
You know what Im talking about

Hey baby whatcha doing tonight
Its butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

Its playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song

In every town in every place
Theres a boy whos trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Aint ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

Its Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
Its daddy getting mad cause you came home late
Its one last kiss in the driveway
Hey radio DJ can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

In every town in every place
Theres a boy whos trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Aint ever gonna quit playing on and on and on and on

So lets raise a glass cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines weve tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets
To the ones that you aint met yet

In every town in every place
Theres a boy whos trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Aint ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

As long as youre crazy over me

You can fuss about your hair

I thank God every day  that youre my lady
Now thats a little crazy
So go on and be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as youre crazy over me
Crazy over me
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

Thank God Im yours
Thank God Im yours
Thank God Im yours
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We cant seem to let go girl

So Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over

Im all alone but youre on my phone
Tellin me you miss me and that youre at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin
All I know is I want you

So Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over
Ooh Im comin over

Yeah we said that were done and I know that its late
But you already know Im on my way

Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire thats burnin
Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over
Im comin over
 CHAPTER ONE
 I can well believe that it is something came with conviction from the footman who had not detected the irony
 I can tell you its better down there under the cherry trees than standing before the fire all day
 But it was at Combray surely that you used to be with a cousin of Madame asked the young footman
 What on earth can they be doing Theyve been at least two hours at their dinner
 Then you wont be going down to Guermantes Castle this year
 And to the theatre do you go sometimes
 Run along and light the fire in my quarters he called to a trooper who passed us Hurry up get a move on
 And he has given you leave I cried
 He hadnt the slightest objection
 Oh I adore him
We were several times interrupted by one or other of SaintLoups friends coming in He drove them all out again
 Get out of here Buzz off
I begged him to let them stay
 Thats not the officer whos given me leave to stay here tonight
 What are you doing now I asked him
 Then its been a great bother to you coming here
 What was the waistcoat like
 He wasnt wearing a white waistcoat it was purple with sort of palms on it stunning
 It was the height of my pack
 Where did I hear it From his batman what dyou think
 Ah Now youre talking Thats a chap who knows when hes well off
 Why yes my good aunt
 Thats all right go on as long as you like They can wait
 Do you know that worthy Oriane then
 I cant say I havent seen her since the summer because I havent had any leave since shes been in town
 What I was going to say is this Ive been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot
 That I do not believe Oriane is not exactly an eagle but all the same shes by no means stupid
 Not only should I have done it I will do it
 When
 Next time Im in Paris three weeks from now I expect
 We shall see I dare say she wont want to see me though I cant tell you how grateful I am
 Not at all its nothing
 Bore me My dear fellow Joy Tears of joy Undreamedof happiness
 I can do both
 Yes
 Youre quite sure you know who I mean
 Why what do you take me for a village idiot
 You wouldnt care to give me her photograph I suppose
 No I should have to ask her permission first was his answer
I gave a sigh of relief for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again
 I was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc I seemed to hear him speaking
 But what do you mean by that
 Give me an example or two if you dont mind
 Ah Interchangeable very neat Excellent The lad has brains was SaintLoups comment
 Why yes environment is of no importance
And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting or failing to understand him
 The real influence is that of ones intellectual environment One is the man of ones idea
 You dont happen to have had any news from Paris
 Yes he replied gloomily bad news
 It was an idiotic dream he concluded still quite breathless
 To Balbec But you didnt go there till August
 I know but next year theyre making me go there earlier for my health
 Why of course I do
 You remember how much I admired his work
 I do quite well and the letter we sent him
 Of course I do How involved youre getting
 Is that she has in her house one very fine picture at least by Elstir
 I say I never knew that
 Thats all right Ill answer for her Ill make a special point of it
 Oh Robert you are an angel I do love you
 You havent seen Serjeant SaintLoup have you by any chance I asked
 Hes gone on parade sir said the old soldier
 I never saw him said the graduate
 Sir asked the old soldier angrily
 Right you are Lets begin now
 The poor martyr she almost sobbed it will be the death of him in that dreadful place
 There you are beginning again I knew it was coming
And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation
I did not know whether I was expected to follow him
Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress
 But my dear boy theres nothing more than what youve just said
 What a bore you are Then tell her about Franoise in the ChampsElyses Shell enjoy that
 Oh thats too lovely the way he copies himself she cried clapping her hands
 Oh What a good thing it would be if you did go
 I warn you if I do I shant come back
 Thats more than I should venture to hope
 But my dear boy he went on to me you oughtnt to stand about here I tell you it will make you cough
I pointed to the scenery which barred my way He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists
 Would you mind sir throwing away your cigar the smoke is bad for my friend
His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her on her way to her dressingroom she turned round and
The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress
 Oh Do stop Youll make me quite mad she cried to him Then there will be trouble
 What didnt it strike you You must be going blind
 What I say is that youre a pack of curs growled the journalist whom SaintLoup had punished
 Ah I see another fine portrait began the historian
The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room
 It is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme la Marquise
 Did you tell him I was at home
 He heard the voices
She shrugged her shoulders smiling as though he had been trying to make fun of her and turned to the historian
 And this is the famous Marie de Rohan Duchesse de Chevreuse who was married first of all to M de Luynes
Mme de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil
 I was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog
Mme de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment
 No no he said dont leave them on the floor theyll be trodden on
 What is that persons name I was asked by the Baron who had just been introduced to me by Mme de Villeparisis
 M Pierre I whispered
 Pierre what
 Pierre its his name hes a historian a most distinguished man
 Really You dont say so
Everyone had gathered round Mme de Villeparisis to watch her painting
 Ah The flowers of their period That is a most ingenious theory exclaimed Legrandin
 No theyre apple blossom said the Duchesse de Guermantes addressing her aunt
 Ah I see youre a good countrywoman like me you can tell one flower from another
 I never see them said the young Duke because they give me hay fever Such a bore
 Hay fever I never heard of that before said the historian
 Its the fashionable complaint just now the librarian informed him
Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme de Villeparisis was painting
 I hear theyve been down here bothering you I trust things are going better
 You are not in a hurry she now asked Bloch
 Do you mean to say you know her Duchess asked M dArgencourt
 Do you mean to tell me she performed in your house M dArgencourt asked the Duchess
 You know who were talking about Basin the Duchess asked her husband
 I can make a pretty good guess said the Duke
 Ah As an actress shes not Im afraid in what one would call the great tradition
 You cant imagine went on Mme de Guermantes to M dArgencourt anything more ridiculous
 Mysterious Oh I must confess cousin thats a bit beyond me said the Comte dArgencourt
But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise SaintLoups choice
 Oh oh muttered Mme de Villeparisis
 Oh I say cried M dArgencourt
 But I understood she wasnt at all bad at reciting poetry said one of the two young men
Everybody laughed
The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde
 M Legrandin
 But its a great distinction to look like a Queen said the historian of the Fronde
Bloch and M de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us
 Well sir asked Mme de Villeparisis have you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case
M de Norpois made no reply
 The Dreyfus case
 Indeed then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking put in M dArgencourt
 What can one expect the Duke went on with the influence hes come under its easy to understand
 Ah I thought it was the Prime Ministers wife said M dArgencourt
Bloch tried to pin M de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart
 There he is a Dreyfusard theres not the least doubt of it thought Bloch
 But those documents are obviously forged put in Bloch
 Arent they rather bad form rather stuckup snobs these Sagans he inquired in a tone of sarcasm
Mme de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme de Guermantes
 Tell us is it a great social solemnity Mme de Sagans ball
 I assure you Oriane she is really quite nice an excellent woman said Mme de Marsantes
 I have no doubt she is but I feel no need to assure myself of it
 Have you been invited to Lady Israelss Mme de Villeparisis asked the Duchess to change the conversation
 Robert here But I have never had a single word from him I dont think Ive seen him since Balbec
 He is so busy he has so much to do pleaded Mme de Marsantes
 Well talk of the Saint said Mme de Guermantes
 What Youve come How delightful What a surprise
 Good afternoon Robert she said I believe hes forgotten his aunt
 Good afternoon how are you was her greeting
We were both silent
Robert came up to us he had caught only the name of Mme de SaintFerrol
 Bring him in sir said Mme de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador who started in quest of the German Minister
 Stop sir do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte
The following winter the Prince was seriously ill he recovered but his heart was permanently affected
That evening he met M de Norpois again at the Opera
Mme de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time
 Gracious I must fly at once if Im to get to Mme de SaintFerrols and Im dining with Mme Leroi
 How tired and worried you look said Mme de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M de Charlus
 Never mind his mother went on stroking his cheek never mind its good to see my little boy again
 He is quite right she replied
 Did you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now I asked Mme Swann
 I dont know I didnt realise her she replied sourly using an expression borrowed from England
Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were
 You have been good to me I said how can I thank you Can we dine together tomorrow
 To think that for once in his life he wasnt lying Its incredible would have been Blochs comment
 Youd better take care sir I warned him you have picked up the wrong hat by mistake
Robert swept me back to his mother
 What Robert youre going away Seriously My little son The one day Ive seen anything of you
 You know its not at all nice of you
 Its unfortunate but nice or not thats how it is
I accompanied her there
 Robert Robert she called No hes gone we are too late
 I have been so interested so glad to have this little talk with you Thank you Thank you
 But I am in no hurry I replied besides I must wait for M de Charlus I am going with him
 Youre going from here with my nephew Palamde she asked me
As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me
 So this is how you wait for me is it
It was M de Charlus
 You wished to speak to me about something Sir
I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swanns closer now than at Balbec
 Which way are you going
 Yours This surprised me for M de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps
 Well I dont want to get up on the box Dyou mind if I stay down here
He jumped in beside the cabman took the reins and the horse trotted off
 But Sir I have a temperature
He laid a finger on her wrist
 But I have a little albumen as well
 You see Madame I didnt know that and yet I could have told you
 But do you want me to take a cure like that Sir came to a frightened voice from my grandmother
 So youre still here he was saying You dont think of retiring
 You wouldnt like me to open a little place for you
And on my declining
 Ive nothing disengaged Maam
 Will they be long asked the poor lady reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat
 I was afraid you were feeling sick Grandmamma are you feeling better now I asked her
Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her without alarming me not to make some answer
I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words
 Mamma you will soon be quite well again your daughter will see to that
 Forgive me for disturbing your sleep she said to me
 I was not asleep I answered as I awoke
 My poor boy you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now
 Yet the barometer is very low put in my father
 Where did you say the weather was bad asked my grandfather
 At Combray
 Yes Beethoven they told me about it its worth framing still Im not surprised
My mother spoke Oh but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing
 But I thought she couldnt see anything now said my father
 One can never be sure replied the doctor
Eightynine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

This thing burns gas like crazy but thats alright
People got their ways of copin oh and Ive got mine

I drive your truck

Every back road in this town

It was laying pennies on the rails and sneaking off to chew Red Man
It was a Friday night win and followed by a Saturday bruise
It was a first Blue Ribbon my dad and I drank baptized on Glenville lake
A tear in our eyes the night we lost all we had to lose
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddys name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Oh Carolina can
It was faded blue denim on Franklin Street
A Hes Not buzz a house band beat
It was a summer heat dragging me to a fifth year fall
It was classes skipped cause the room couldnt teach
What we learned three days on Wrightsville beach
With my high school love short hair
And that sweet hometown southern drawl
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddys name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah Carolina can
Carolina can
Now two time zones ten states away
Another night another show to play
Oh hey Mr Taylor she aint only on your mind
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddys name
The six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah when I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah Carolina can

She dont laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She dont step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She dont need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a TiltAWhirl

I met a girl she made me smile
She made me wait she crossed the street
She crossed my heart she fixed her dress
She bit her lip she lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes
And baby blues the way she moves
Is changin my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up
Shes a ponytail no makeup Saturday
Cause she dont need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls

I met a girl she made me smile
She made me wait she crossed the street
She crossed my heart she fixed her dress
She bit her lip she lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes
And baby blues the way she moves
Is changin my whole world

She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And Im so glad she didnt walk away
She dances like nobody sees her
Cant believe I get to be here in her world

I met a girl she made me smile
She made me wait she crossed the street
She crossed my heart she fixed her dress
She bit her lip she lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes
And baby blues the way she moves
Is changin my whole world
I met a girl
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
Told him just how our story ends
Did all I could to try to make it work
But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

Ive been at the house climbin them walls
Checkin that calendar xin days off
Hit another bar call another friend
Throw a few down tell the story again

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Im finally gettin out back into the world
Life is good I met me a girl
She got a beautiful heart eyes are blue

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Sometimes I break down and cry

Hey hey what can I say

Hadnt had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I wouldve just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldnt be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it aint but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
She looks so pretty with no makeup on With no makeup on
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone To her mama on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song Eminem song
Thats my girl
Man her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl yeah

Yeah thats my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down dancing around causing a scene
Thats my girl sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap turned back ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again

Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head

Windows down dancing around causing a scene

The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever lay the seat back laughin
You slippin off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of Night Moves

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe youre right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be wanna be wanna be wanna be that song
Oh I wanna be I wanna I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin out your heart
pourin out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When youre sittin all alone
When the rain is pourin and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe youre right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be wanna be wanna be wanna be that song
Oh I wanna be I wanna I wanna

When youre searching the horizon searching the horizon
When your eyes look back
When youre standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack

Oh I wanna be I wanna be oh I wanna be

Makes you dance makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe youre right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highways calling
When the bottles dry
When the sky is falling and youre asking yourself why
Oh oh I wanna bewanna bewanna be yeah oh
Girl youre getting over him and Im getting over her
The eyes have it made aint gotta say a word
Misery loves company thats why its you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim getting even with her and with him before the night is over

We better keep on keeping it lit

Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light

She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the roadside
Went to high school here got that Panther pride
Shell be cheering them on every Friday night

She couldnt hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldnt help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 
But she never forgot where she came from

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mammas mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
Shes a good girl but shes not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Shes got an old soul shes the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what its worth
Theres a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But theres nothing like the one right across the street

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Ooh ooh
Right now we both know

Planes gonna fly away
And youll be on it
And by This Time Tomorrow
Ill be singing Yesterday
The sunshines gonna fade
And we cant stop it
So before we turn in I Cant Make You Love Me

Lets be Brown Eyed Girl Sweet Caroline
Freefallin Small Town Saturday Night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Lets go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon Ill be so lonesome I could cry
But thats a song for another time

Just for One More Day What Do You Say
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday mornings coming down
Lets take a drive you and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But lets pretend were

Brown Eyed Girl sweet caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Lets go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon youll be always on my mind
But thats a song for another time

So before were singing I will always love you

Lets sing brown eyed girl sweet caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Lets go dancing on the ceiling

Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon Ill be so lonesome I could cry
But thats a song for another time

Yeah thats a song for another time
Brown eyed girl sweet caroline
Yeah thats a song for another time
Free fall small town Saturday night
Thats a song for another time
Im a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
Im a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
Im a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And thats how Ill always be
Im a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
Im a little more ol Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol front porch made of an old oak tree
And thats how Ill always be

Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things
Thats how Ill always be

I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles raisin hell in cowboy boots
But hey on Sunday morning Ill take the back row seat
Thats how Ill always be

Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things
Thats how Ill always be

Im a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin down
Handshake deals freshcut hay fields and hometowns

Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things
Thats how Ill always be
Thats how Ill always be
Thats how Ill always be
Thats how Ill always be
Its good to be out again good to see all my friends

Cause feeling sorry for myself wasnt working out so well
Awe but baby look at me now

And to think I thought I would hurt forever

But baby tonight Im alright yea I finally got you off my mind

Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think Im drowning in my sorrows
But I swear Ill never love you again til tomorrow

But Ill worry about the morning in the morning

Cause baby tonight Im alright yea I finally got you off my mind

Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think Im drowning in my sorrows

And it dawns on me that I need you when Im sober
So maybe youre right its time
To get over you and get on with my life

You think Im drowning in my sorrows

You figure out loves got four letters

She put the hang in hangover hangover
She put the ex in sex

Theres a girl somewhere in Tupelo
Whos with a guy she barely knows
Who will probably sell his soul for a kiss
Theres a girl somewhere in Arkansas
Whos talking with a southern drawl
And a guy who cant stop staring at her lips

And aint it crazy
How they make us all so crazy

Why would we drive  miles one way
Blow through cash that we aint made
Get tattoos and wash our trucks
Push and press our luck
Why would we ask when we know we cant dance
Show our hands and change our plans
Lose our minds break our hearts
And learn to play guitar
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world
Cause theres a girl
Cause theres a girl

Theres a girl somewhere with eyes so blue
You know a call it just wont do
So here I am on Highway 
First girl to get me to ask myself
How Id been with anyone else any other minute of my life

Aint it something
How they get us doing something

Why would we drive  miles one way
Blow through cash that we aint made
Get tattoos and wash our trucks
Push and press our luck
Why would we ask when we know we cant dance
Show our hands and change our plans
Lose our minds break our hearts
And learn to play guitar
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world
Cause theres a girl
Cause theres a girl

Aint it crazy
How they get us going crazy

Why would we drive  miles one way
Blow through cash that we aint made
Get tattoos and wash our trucks
Push and press our luck
Why would we ask when we know we cant dance
Show our hands and change our plans
Lose our minds break our hearts
Learn to play guitar
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world
Cause theres a girl
Cause theres a girl
She dont throw any tshirt on and walk to a bar
She dont text her friends and say I gotta get laid tonight
She dont say Its okay I never loved him anyway
She dont scroll through her phone just looking for a BandAid

Its different for girls when their hearts get broke
They cant tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They dont take someone home and act like its nothing
They cant just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
But its different for girls

She dont sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She dont have the luxury to let herself go
She wont call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough yeah the guys they can just act tough

Its different for girls when their hearts get broke
They cant tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They dont take someone home and act like its nothing
They cant just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
But its different for girls

Its different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears they cant pretend it was never there

A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough yeah the guys they can just act tough
So tough
Its different for girls
Its different for girls
Baby it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like weve been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didnt they know you cant leave someone
Girl you cant leave someone

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Whyd you have to go then
Baby in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda coulda woulda been the night of our lives
Girl it aint right no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory

We were gonna dance till they shut it down
Peopled be staring while I spin you round
Thinking we were so in love yeah
They wouldnt know we hadnt even hooked up
Id get your number and Id give you mine
And wed be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I dont know where you are
Im under these lights right here in the dark

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Whyd you have to go then
Baby in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda coulda woulda been the night of our lives
Girl it aint right no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory yeah

Yeah its like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no youll never know girl what you did to me
It aint right saying goodbye

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what couldve been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Whyd you have to go then
Baby in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda coulda woulda been the night of our lives
But girl it aint right no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
Midnights creepin in we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
Youve never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

When your friends start asking you
Look em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say were just friends
But baby til then
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more

Think a little less

Ill go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Aint gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause weve already waited way too long to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing weve been thinking bout doing
Since the moment girl we met

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more

Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress

Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust but everybody we know does

Thats what we do thats what we love
Thats how we were raised how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins way down in our blood

Put your boots to the ground til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks til we come back around
Nah it aint no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin
Not everybody knows what were made of but
Everybody we know does

Runs deep in our veins way down in our blood
Everybody we know does

How to be proud of that town aint nobody heard of
Had a big dream seventeen some day how to grow up
How to make dust fly out on a no name road
Yeah I learned it from the radio

How to wake up how to work tough
How to roll up those sleeves how to throw down
How to get loud and what to put in that drink
To give the stars in the sky a little halo
Yeah I learned it from the radio

If it wasnt for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadnt ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
Id have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJs in all those little static towns
How to live how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

What to say when you think that youve found that girl
Who to call when shes gone and she wrecks your world
How to get over it yeah how to let her go
I learned it from the radio

How to see it all from a front porch
And how to say it all just using three chords
And when to run when youre young
When to come back home
I learned it from the radio

If it wasnt for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadnt ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
Id have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJs in all those little static towns
How to live how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we use to burn it up turn it up up up

If it wasnt for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I havent ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
Id have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJs in all those little static towns
How to live how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin pictures of people we thought were stars
Its easy to give in to your heart
When youre drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your tshirt
We were screamin cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me and we were 

Up all night and we were feelin so good
Yeah we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin in the hallway lights
We were strikin the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire setting the world on fire

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin out the window like they could hear us at the pier
Said Do you think well live forever As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless we were all lit up and restless
And comin alive and we were

Up all night and we were feelin so good
Yeah we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin in the hallway lights
We were strikin the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire setting the world on fire

Oh yeah yeah

Yeah we were up all night and we were feelin so good
Yeah we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin in the hallway lights
We were strikin the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire setting the world on fire

World all  on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
World all on fire
If I could kill a word and watch it die
Id poison never shoot goodbye
Beat regret when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah Id pound fear to a pile of sand
Choke lonely out with my bare hands
Id hang hate so that it cant be heard
If I could only kill a word

Id take brokeness out back
And break heartbreak stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin it the bird
Id put upset down in its place
Id squeeze the life out of disgrace
Lay over under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

Give me sticks give stones
Bend my body break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you cant unhear you cant unsay
But if were up to me to change
Id turn lies and hate to love and truth
If I could only kill a word

Id knock out temptations teeth
Id sever evil let it bleed
Then light up wicked stand and watch it burn
Id take vice and Id take vile
Tie em up there with hostile
Hang em high and leave em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

So give me sticks give stones
Bend my body break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you cant unhear you cant unsay
But if were up to me to change
Id turn lies and hate to love and truth
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word
We werent supposed to be there
Parked on the beach where
Sand felt more like an hourglass
We were both pretending summer wouldnt end
If we stayed there right on the front of that Pontiac
Kicking back drivers side window cracked with the radio up
Just the two of us

Lying on the hood of my car under the stars
Falling as hard as they were
Didnt know we didnt mean it
Swore we believed it took it too far
She said forever I said Ill never
Let her out of these arms
But the truth is we were just lying
Lying on the hood of my car
I can still remember
Bare feet on the fender
Salt waves in her hair from the water
The engine wasnt running
But it heated up
When she tossed that tank top off of that Pontiac
Breathing fast hearts beating over that radio all the way up
Knowing were just

Lying on the hood of my car under the stars
Falling as hard as they were
Didnt know we didnt mean it
Swore we believed it took it too far
She said forever I said Ill never
Let her out of these arms
But the truth is we were just lying
Lying on the hood of my car
Lying on the hood of my car
Had that back seat packed up with all my stuff
When we promised that wed keep in touch
It turns out we were just

Lying on the hood of my car under the stars
Falling as hard as they were
Didnt know we didnt mean it
Swore we believed it took it too far
She said forever I said Ill never
Let her out of these arms
But the truth is we were just lying
Lying on the hood of my car
Lying on the hood of my car
She said forever I said Ill never
Lying on the hood of my car
Hadnt had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I wouldve just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldnt be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Yeah you hit me Category 
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it aint but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Girl you never looked better than you do in that black dress
I cant stop my eyes from riding the lines of your silhouette
And that sunset sinking down lows got me thinking
What we both know we both know
That the bedrooms calling our name up the hall and
We both know where its gonna go

Your body on mine

And well blame it on the red wine if ya wanna
Take it nice and slow yeah you know were gonna
Pull those shades down tight make it last all night

With your eyes locked on mine between you and I theres no secrets

Girl you never looked better than you do in that black dress
Sometimes Im the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl you change all that

And Im just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin you were there alone
Wonderin how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin over at ya like aint she beautiful
Im invisible but I stand right there and smile
Youre right beside me oh and I see the same thing theyre seein
But I dont mind being the guy with the girl no

Its funny watchin em do the way they do
They come walkin up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I dont blame em that theyre hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
Its like their heart starts stoppin when you come walkin into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin you were there alone
Wonderin how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin over at ya like aint she beautiful
Im invisible but I stand right there and smile
Youre right beside me oh and I see the same thing theyre seein
But I dont mind being the guy with the girl

I feel terrible sunlights hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable and Im missing you and me
Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets

No Im not hungover its true but Im still not over you
All messed up all strung out
I was sitting at home breaking down
Not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
Im just getting over another sober Saturday night

Besides the pain I dont feel a thing
When my buddies call me up I just let it ring

No Im not hungover its true but Im still not over you
All messed up all strung out
I was sitting at home breaking down
Not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
Im just getting over another sober Saturday night

No Im not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
Im just getting over another sober Saturday night
She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good she grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher free as a weed
Couldnt wait to get goin but wasnt quite ready to leave
So innocent pure and sweet
American honey

Theres a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind
Callin out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just want to go back in time
To American honey

Theres a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind
Callin out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I got to get back to her somehow
To American honey

Theres a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind
Callin out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin sweeter than summertime
And American honey

And American honey
May we all get to grow up in a red white and blue little town
Get a wontstart handmedown Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you cant wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing aint cool til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
Shes smilin with her hair blowing out the window
Where you bout to go
Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all

May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Aint gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
Well all be watching the TV the day that it comes

May we all know that nothing aint cool til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the Pac
Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
Shes smilin with her hair blowing out the window
Where you bout to go
Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all

May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
May we all walk away wiser when we crashed one
May we all keep hoping that the best one is the last one
yeah the last one
Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all
Theres a slow moon rising
Its shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know theres no holding back
No holding back

I wouldnt be a man if I didnt feel like this
I wouldnt be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
Id have to be from another planet
Where love doesnt exist
I wouldnt be a man if I didnt feel like this

I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me theres no holding back
No holding back
When Im sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
Im gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well Im feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

I dont know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

I know it wont always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
Its not over yet and I already miss
Today

I dont know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that youre gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today
Bring on tomorrow Ive got today
Bring on tomorrow Ive got today
Bring on tomorrow right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life
Tomorrow Im gonna leave here
Im gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
And tomorrow Im gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that were no good

But tonight Im gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
Were like fire and gasoline
Im no good for you youre no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight Im gonna love you like theres no

Tomorrow Ill be stronger
Im not gonna break down and call you up
When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow you wont believe it
But when I pass your house I wont stop
No matter how bad I want to

But tonight Im gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
Were like fire and gasoline
Im no good for you youre no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight Im gonna love you like theres no
Tomorrow

Baby when were good you know were great
But theres too much bad for us to think
That theres anything worth trying to save

But tonight Im gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
Were like fire and gasoline
Im no good for you youre no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight Im gonna love you like theres no

Tomorrow Im gonna leave here
Yeah Im gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
Theres a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin only evil remains
Watch out brother for that long black train
Look to the heavens you can look to the sky
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and theres peace the same
Burning your ticket for that long black train

Because theres victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And dont go riding on that long black train

Theres an engineer on that long black train
Making you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
Hes just awaiting on your heart to say
Let me ride on that long black train

But you know theres victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And dont go riding on that long black train

Well I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty making everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere

But you know theres victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And dont go riding on that long black train

I said cling to the Father and his Holy name
And dont go riding on that long black train
Yeah watch out brother for that long black train
That devils adriving that long black train
Fast
Thats the kind of car you wanna drive when youre sixteen
Fast
Thats the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah you think youre gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It just goes too fast

Fast
Thats what your parents said when we were falling in love
Its too fast
There aint no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did and here we are and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes that dress that smile that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it dont work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast
Theres a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

Well pull the ropes off the boat
Well throw them up on the dock
Well let the stars be our guide
No we dont need no clock

Well set sail
Yeah Ill see you there
Waving your hair with that tshirt on
Dead men tell no tales
Its like nowhere else youve ever been
Well write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall itll still be there
Next time we come back girl
To the bar at the end of the world

In that old seashell you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night its the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called Make Me Disappear

Well throw the ropes off the boat
Well throw them up on the dock
Well let the stars be our guide
No we dont need no clock

Well set sail
Yeah Ill see you there
Waving your hair with that tshirt on
Dead men tell no tales
Its like nowhere else youve ever been
Well write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall itll still be there
Next time we come back girl
To the bar at the end of the world

There aint no empty glasses
Theyre playing Drift Away
Thats where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

Well set sail
Yeah Ill see you there
Waving your hair with that tshirt on
Dead men tell no tales
Its like nowhere else youve ever been
Well write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall itll still be there
Next time we come back girl
To the bar at the end of the world

To the bar at the end of the world
Well set sail
At the end of the world
Well set sail

Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm

The rain is coming down tonight
Im smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and Im flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
Wed be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just cant let it go no I just cant let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin out the window on the back roads Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin on the Lokos Spark and Light
Aint it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time  all that wasted time

Out of nowhere it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew aint nothing like it used to be
Ah I cant explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

And I just cant let it go no I just cant let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin out the window on the back roads Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin on the Locos spark a light
Aint it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey hey now
Summer dresses dryin out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere we were so alive
Uh huh aint it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey you know oh
All that wasted time
Dont you feel it coming on back now
Time time time
Heading down south to the land of the pines
Im thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And Im ahoping for Raleigh I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar I pick a banjo now
Oh north country winters keep agetting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I aint turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But hes a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that shes the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel

Rock me
Hey girl wassup
I know its late but I knew youd pick it up
Naw I aint drunk
Okay maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say youre taken but I say
Girl youre takin too long

To tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Rip it off just like a BandAid
The way you look at me girl you cant pretend
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him

I know you dont wanna break his heart
But that aint no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look just tell him its you it aint him
And maybe you can lie to him and say youll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you aint in love
Cmon you cant deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Rip it off just like a BandAid
It aint my business to be all up in
But I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him break up with him

You wouldve hung up by now
If you werent thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

Id tell him that its over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it cant wait
Just rip it off just like a BandAid
Yeah I know I said it but Ill say it again
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you cant pretend
I know you aint in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him
I was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

I was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought You fool that could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldnt run her down
She probably didnt like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear in a cloud of dust

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Dont know why but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass and sent her right back here to me

Thank God for good directions and turnip greens
Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy

Big stars breaking out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin in and stereo
Tail lights disappear in bout a mile or so
Down a county road
Phone blowing up where you is
Baby sayin baby lets do this
Rocket in a bottle with a fuse lit
Bout to lift it off Im bout to twist it off

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin up a faded out x
Girls headin off to the river yeah
Victorias Secret aint a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where eveybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right its a Friday night
Get your party right its a Friday night

Well baby you aint nothin but a masterpiece
Swayin and sippin that Dos Equis
Losin yourself in the big loud beat nothin but heat
Somebodys rockin that bang box
Everybody hittin that sweet spot
Nobody mindin that tic toc
Gettin all locked in with all my friends

Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You dont have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door
Im strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I wont let that keep us in the ground

Im a riser
Im a get off of the ground dont run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey Im a fighter
When darkness comes to town Im a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

If we aint got no money I can make it
And I aint afraid of working to the bone
When I dont know what Im doing I can fake it
Ill pray til jesus rolls away the stone

Im a riser
Im a get off of the ground dont run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey Im a fighter
When darkness comes to town Im a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

Im a trier
Im a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldnt keep down my desire
Yeah

Im a get off of the ground dont run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey Im a fighter
When darkness comes to town Im a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

Im a riser
Im a riser
Im a riser
Im a riser
I can honestly understand why its over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

But I dont know how not to
Think about you
When its late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But Id probably turn down your road
Knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin myself and the way that I cant help
The way I still want you
I just dont know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just dont know how not to
How not to
How not to

Youre like second nature baby youre just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you cant forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah youre worth the heartbreak and the regret

But I dont know how not to
Think about you
When its late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But Id probably turn down your road
Knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin myself and the way that I cant help
The way I still want you
I just dont know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just dont know how not to
How not to
How not to

How not to
Mmmmmm
Ohohohoh
Bet you had a couple long nights sleepin alone
I bet even on a short drive if our song came on
Youd pull over on the shoulder and cry
Thinkin bout how we used to be
Girl I bet you had a hard time
Gettin over me

Ooh that might be true
But if you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
I dont wanna make light
Of what youre going through
But if you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
Try getting try getting try getting over you

Bet you never taste my kiss in a rum and coke
Bet you never spent all night at that old bar
Prayin waitin hopin
That I might walk into your arms again
Like we never said goodbye
Make the cab take the long way by my place
To see if someones parked outside

Ooh even if you do
If you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
I dont wanna make light
Of what youre going through
But if you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
Try getting over you

Youre moving on
And I can barely move
Yeah you got off easy baby
Try getting over you

Ooh from my point of view
If you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
I dont wanna make light
Of what youre going through
But if you think getting over me was hard
Try getting over you
Oh try getting over you girl
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl you know those rumors get to flyin in a town this size
No I didnt feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay til theyre all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I aint sittin round
Tryin to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol barstool

I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin in all these blanks you left isnt all that hard
No I aint wonderin where you been or who you been with
I guess you didnt hurt me half as bad as you think you did

Ask any ol barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay til theyre all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I aint sittin round
Tryin to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol barstool

Yeah you think Im down and out hidin out hellbent crazy
But that aint me baby

Ask any ol barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But Im a long way from broke down
Sure I stay til theyre all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I aint sittin round
Tryin to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol barstool
Ask any ol barstool

I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Theres something bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I dont know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up making love a runaway roller coaster

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
Every time I hear that song
Its like the first time it came on and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
I still think about you

Theres something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying we were wasted
We were dying when they played it

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
Every time I hear that song
Its like the first time it came on and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you

Theres a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
Every time I hear that song
Its like the first time it came on and ohohoh
I still think about you ohohoh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah I still think about you

Theres a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I cant count the times
I almost said whats on my mind
But I didnt
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things Id say
But I couldnt
I just couldnt

Baby I know that youve been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing

In case you didnt know
Baby Im crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
Im thinking

One of the things that Ive been feeling
Mmm its time you hear em

In case you didnt know
Baby Im crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know

Youve got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah youre my everything

In case you didnt know
Im crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know
In case you didnt know
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper lets dont talk
Baby leave my tshirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby well remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
Its time we made it happen

Strip it down strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down down down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They aint holdin nothin these two hands
Until theyre holding you again

Oh strip it down strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down down down
Strip it down down down

I dont wanna let you go
No not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad baby
So lets close our eyes

And strip it down strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down down down
Strip it down down down
Strip it down down down
Strip it down down down
Oh oh oh
Woah woah woah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah yeah

Take off those heels lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while Im pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we dont even care
Candles dripping on your body baby this aint truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body baby sticking like some glue
Naughty lets get naughty girl its only one or two
The fevers fucking running feel the heat between us too

Im gon ride Im gon ride Im gon ride
Im gon ride on you baby on you lady all night all night
Ima take care of your body Ill be gentle dont you scream
Its getting hotter make it softer feel your chest on top of me
Im gon ride Im gon ride Im gon ride
Im gon ride on you baby on you lady all night all night
Im gon make you feel that loving getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet
Yeah girl we can go slow
Yeah we can go slow

Lay on your back like you right there
Dont have to say it twice love theres nothing here to fear
Taking it back back to where its clear
Rolling on and on sounds of loving in the air

Im gon ride Im gon ride Im gon ride

Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein made of gold
I dont know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin Amarillo
Takin that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I cant forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Cause leavin didnt hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance Id lie again

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile
Carolina sun rays sinking on a south side pier
Cotton candy salty kisses and a couple stolen beers
Your tan lines were the map for my hands to find their way
And that empty lifeguard shack we watched our innocence fade
Caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One two three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
In beach town
Sneaking in and getting kicked out at the bayside pool
And watching your tee shirt drip dry
Middle of the night that was so damn cool
And sandals in your hands
Swaying to the beat of an off beat cover band
Spilling your drink making me sink
Deeper and deeper with every half drunk wink
In that beach box salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One two three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
Florida State came calling
Your goodbye tears came falling
I said I dont want to go if you dont want to go
So we just kept on stalling
We kept on stalling
Caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One two three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
Young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
In beach town

Caught between what it means to start over
And what happens over and over again but

I dont wanna see you I dont wanna see you
I dont wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
Ill cut you loose baby fly away
Im holding on to what we had
But I dont wanna hold you I dont wanna hold you back

I get up you get up
We get dressed say I love you
Kiss you goodbye and I finally mean it
It took until now for us both to believe it

And its not like we got back together
Were just coming back to the thing that we know
When you called it off you said its for the better
That dont make it easy for me to let go baby

I dont wanna hold you I dont wanna hold you
I dont wanna hold you back
I dont wanna see you I dont wanna see you
I dont wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
Ill cut you loose baby fly away
Im holding on to what we had
But I dont wanna hold you I dont wanna hold you back

Well call me up if you ever get lonely
Call me up if you ever want me
But until then Im setting you free
And if you ever come back to me baby

I dont wanna hold you I dont wanna hold you
I dont wanna hold you back
I dont wanna see you I dont wanna see you
I dont wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
Ill cut you loose baby fly away
Im holding on to what we had
But I dont wanna hold you I dont wanna hold you back
I was scared I wasnt quite ready yet
Didnt want to let my freedom get
Too far away so I would say anything
To keep you just close enough
Like I need a little space to breathe
A little time for me to think
I just need you to wait for me
But you werent waiting for me

To grow up get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround running from forever
Its too bad we happened when we did
Cause Ive learned a lot about life since then
I cant go back girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
Cause Im man enough now

I guess its something that every boys gotta do
Getting so close to letting it slip through
Your fingers yeah you gotta learn the hard way
Once you do you start to look back on
All the things that you shouldve wouldve couldve done
Bet you never thought that I would

Grow up get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround running from forever
Its too bad we happened when we did
Cause Ive learned a lot about life since then
I cant go back girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
Cause Im man enough

To push my pride out of the way
Make a girl like you wanna stay
It took a while for me to come around
But I am man enough now

I grew up got it all together
I stopped running from forever
Its too bad we happened when we did
Cause Ive learned a lot about life since then
I cant go back girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
So if one more chance is something that you ever think about
Im man enough now
Im man enough now
Its a  day drive if she drives all night
Says shes leavin at the crack of dawn
Well she might still be lyin here with me
But in her heart shes already gone
Already packed up the Altimas gassed up
Shes done put the map up there on the dash
Im all tore up just tryin to man up
Damnin these tears up but cant hold em back

Cause shes in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These aint no Hollywoods
And these hills aint Beverly
Aint no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
Shes in love with California
And breakin my heart

Got a waitress job waitin in an ihop
Throw a rock and hit universal city
Got a glamour shot in her hip pocket
Hopin somebodyll think shes pretty
By this time tomorrow shell hit Colorado
Ill be drownin my sorrow in a bottle of Beam
Before she hits flagstaff maybe shell backtrack
But I wouldnt bet that if I was me

Cause shes in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These aint no Hollywoods
And these hills aint Beverly
Aint no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
Shes in love with California
And breakin my heart

Shes in love with California
And breakin my heart
Oh shes breakin my heart
Theres one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin in the sky with a wish left on it
And its yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbors yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby just call it
Cause its yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up banged up scarred up heart
Thats been waitin on a girl like you
I know it aint much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby its yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when its cold

Youve got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And its just made for fallin
And its yours if you want it

Every blade of grass under our feet

Thats been waitin on a girl like you

Rohrer fence post starin right back at me

Still hotter than hell in the shade at seven

And buy us a drink
To sip on

Watchin that summer drip on
Fields of green

Life goes on it aint always pretty

Theres a Mickey Mouse magnet on a Frigidaire
Holdin me and you laughin at the county fair

Just like these dusty nowhere roads

Its either hurryup or waitin
I love it that you like the way I sing
Sunday mornin cigarette Amazing Grace

What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I dont even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you theres no fixing me
Cause everybodys already tried

Would you stay Would you leave
I could wait itll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things Ive done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When theres no one there to see
Would you look the other way could you love me anyway

What if I told you I dont plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your familys gonna want you to stay
You know what I dont blame them

So Ill say what I dont want to
And Ill just pray you want what I do

If I told you all the stupid things Ive done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When theres no one there to see
Could you look the other way could you love me anyway
Oh could you love me anyway

So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
Theres some things you probably dont wanna hear
But you have to

If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes Im half crazy
Would you say the hell with me the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if thats what this is
I dont wanna let it slip away oh no no no
Could you love me anyway please
Could you love me anyway
Could you love me anyway ooh
Could you love me anyway
Scuff mark scars on the kitchen floor
A decade of dancing dug into the boards
Every scratch part of the story it tells
A pocketknife blade in my backyard tree
Two names in a heart for the world to see
Might be crude but its a symphony
Of LOVE
You got a melody make em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now start right here
Cause the world keeps spinnin like an old Victrola
Round and round over and over
When the needle drops down what you gonna do
Life is a record better cut your groove
Cut your groove
A lot of the time youre gonna be on top
But when you fall off the charts dont let it stop you
Cause part of the charm is the crack on a pop and a hiss
Theres a song for the taste of your first kiss
A tune for the blues you feel when you miss
The one you love but cant be with
Its a crazy trip its a crazy trip
You got a melody make em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now start right here
Cause the world keeps spinnin like an old Victrola
Round and round over and over
When the needle drops down what you gonna do
Life is a record better cut your groove
Cut your groove
Dont matter what it is as long as its true
Itll be unique to the story of you
You dont have to be famous to be famous
Aside Bside let it all play
Dont let the music just fade away
You dont have to be famous to be famous no
You got a melody make em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now start right here
Cause the world keeps spinnin like an old Victrola
Round and round over and over
When the needle drops down what you gonna do
Life is a record better cut your groove
Cut your groove
Im a dirt road in the headlights
Im a mamas boy Im a fist fight
Kinda county line kinda cold beer
Little hat down little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda dont care
You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me

Hey hey
Keep your chin up
Hey hey

I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough
Or did the heartland just swallow em up
How did my mom and my dad ever do it
If there was struggles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

You know you cant keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You cant keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like youre jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole things really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like theres no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like theres no such thing as a broken heart

What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts laugh when its funny
Chase after the dream dont chase after the money
And know we got each other
Thats whats up

Cause you cant keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You cant keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like youre jumping off a rope swing

You gotta love love love love love like theres no such thing
You gotta love love love love love as a broken heart
You gotta love like theres no such thing as a broken heart
Whooo umm yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We wont hesitate
To break down the garden gate
Theres not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouvers lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway

If you are going my way

Give me give me give me give me yeah

I wasnt there to get drunk but it happened
Cause I never wanted to say goodbye
We were just friends just hanging
Just sitting round waiting for somebody to cross the line

We found love in a bar
In the back of a patio corner
Away from the lights

Well the two of us could disappear
Just say the word well get outta here
Baby you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people save her daddy some money

Ooh she got it all planned out
Yeah I can see it all right now

Ill wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back
Ill do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah she wanna get married
But she dont wanna marry me

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah I kinda freaked out weve been friends for forever
And Id always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite I knew it was too late

And I know her daddys been dreading this day
Oh but he dont know he aint the only one giving her away

Ill do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees

But she dont wanna marry me

I could try to find her get it off of my chest now
But I aint gonna mess it up so I wish her the best now

Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah she wanna get married
Yeah she gonna get married
But she aint gonna marry me
Whoa but she aint gonna marry me no
Drink a little beer play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a Tennessee girl a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol yellow moon
A new set of strings on my 
And a Yeti full of iceddown booze
Everybody round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post

Yeah were gonna drink a little beer play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So were gonna drink a little beer play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a pig in the ground stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a wornout path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along

Yeah were gonna drink a little beer play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes

And have a big time tonight

Cruisin up and down Main in my F
Roll the windows down bass too loud from this burnt CD
Ill be right where I wanna be when Im sixteen sixteen yeah

Now that I can drive finally feel alive but I got this curfew
Sneakin in late smelling like my girlfriends perfume
People talkin bout college and knowledge and thats alright
But all Im thinkin bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

What I wouldnt give to be eighteen wild and free
Buzzin off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin old enough to pull off this fake ID
Ill be right where I wanna be when Im eighteen eighteen
Eighteen yeah

But they turn me away when I go to the CottonEyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener and I believe thats right
But my friends are off to Vegas and theyre leavin me behind

What I wouldnt give to be twenty one wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls go see the world let my wild streak run
Ill be right where I wanna be when Im twenty one twenty one
Woah when Im twenty one
Yeah when Im twenty one itll be alright
Yeah itll all be alright when Im twenty one

Now Im twenty five and Im drinkin wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen
Six months passed since we both said goodbye
Never thought that Id run into you here tonight
And I cant ever think your smiles the same as it was
Back when I saw you every day
I probably shouldnt say it
What Im about to say

We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world people wanted what we had
We could have it again dont you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

You havent stopped me yet so I guess Ill keep going on
Oh and I havent even deleted your number from my phone
Ive been wanting to call you every single day
But I couldnt think how to rephrase everything
So just tell me babe
If you feel the same way

We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world
People wanted what we had
We could have it again dont you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back
We could make a comeback if you just come back
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world people wanted what we had
We could have it again dont you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

Six months passed since we both said goodbye
Never saw it coming never seen nothing like it
Kinda like a drug I didnt need till I tried it one night
Now I want it all the time
Only thing on my mind yeah it drives me crazy
Gave you my heart even though we both knew you would break it
It aint right
Oh but I cant lie

You get me every time
We go out in style
Before that smoke clears
Leaves a high that loves to hang around here
You can put me through hell if its a hell of a time
No I dont mind it baby
Long as it takes Ill be right here waiting
On the same mistake I keep making
Cause Ill do it again
I wanna do it again
Baby just say when

Know that Im just a guy that you dial when youve had too much
When youre broken down from another breakup
Just when I think Im not falling in the same old trap
Keep coming back cause just like that

You get me every time

Before that smoke clears
Leaves a high that loves to hang around here
You can put me through hell if its a hell of a time

Cause Ill do it again
I wanna do it again

She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought aw shell be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall an said

That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said give it away
Just give it away
And I said now honey dont you even want
Your half of everything
She said give it away
Just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away


So Im still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She dont care about anymore
Mmm like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where all our love was made
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away

Ive got a furnished house a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I cant even give it away
Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well Id been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol Red
Now Ol Red hes the damnedest dog that Ive ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
Hes a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that Ive been here
Arent nobody got past Red

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why dont you run
Ol Reds itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Redll have you treed before the morning comes

Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
Bout a mile just south of the gate
And Id take Ol Red for his evening run
Id just drop him off and wait

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why dont you run
Ol Reds itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Redll have you treed before the morning comes

Now Ol Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol Red was headed south

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why dont you run
Ol Reds itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Redll have you treed before the morning comes

Now theres red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out
Whatcha got

I was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

I was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought You fool that could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldnt run her down
She probably didnt like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear in a cloud of dust

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Dont know why but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass and sent her right back here to me

Thank God for good directions and turnip greens
She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
Itd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didnt pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didnt even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cant do this on my own
Im letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road Im on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said Im sorry for the way
Ive been living my life
I know Ive got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cant do this on my own
Im letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road Im on
Oh Jesus take the wheel

Oh Im letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road Im on
From this road Im on
Jesus take the wheel

Oh take it take it from me
Oh wow ooh
We got winners we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar

We got cowboys we got truckers
Brokenhearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers we got fighters
Early birds and allnighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar

I love this bar
Its my kind of place
Just walkin through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It aint too far come as you are
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar

Ive seen short skirts we got hightechs
Bluecollar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers lots of lookers
And Ive even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
Yes I do

I like my truck I like my truck
I like my girlfriend I like my girlfriend
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then
But I love this bar
Its my kind of place
Just trollin around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge come as you are
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumbass and a wiseguy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car
Reason number  why
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
Play it on out boys
Beerthirtys over
Got to take it on home
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
Hmm hmm hmm I love this bar
I just love it
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said Ill love her til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa

The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on thats soft and slow
Baby we aint got no place to go
I hope you understand

Ive been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I cant believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Theres no hurry
Dont you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on thats soft and slow
Baby we aint got no place to go
I hope you understand

Ive been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I cant believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Aint nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
Were alone now
You dont know how
Long Ive wanted to
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on thats soft and slow
Baby we aint got no place to go
I hope you understand

Ive been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I cant believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I cant believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said Marry me Juliet
Youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes

Oh oh
Oh oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin slow
An so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But its July
Im gettin paid by the hour an older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
Id like to call him somethin
I think Ill just call it a day

Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

Oh this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An half the night
Tomorrow mornin I know therell be hell to pay
Hey but thats all right
I aint had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacations gonna start right here
If the phones for me
You can tell em I just sailed away

And pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

I could pay off my tab pour myself in a cab
An be back to work before two
At a moment like this I cant help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do
Funny you should ask Alan Id say
Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
Pour me somethin tall an strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
Its only halfpast twelve but I dont care
He dont care
I dont care
Its five oclock somewhere

What time zone am I on What country am I in
It doesnt matter its five oclock somewhere
Its always on five in Margaritaville come to think of it
Yeah I heard that
You been there havent you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
Ive been to Margaritaville a few times
All right thats good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha between the buoys I tell you
All right Well its five oclock Lets go somewhere
Im ready crank it up
Lets get out of here
Im gone
Im waiting on the sun to set cause yesterday aint over yet
I started smoking cigarettes theres nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads aint made for walking spinning tires aint made for stopping
Im giving up on love cause loves given up on me

I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life aint hard but its too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie cheating really aint a crime
Im giving up on love cause loves given up on me

Forget your high society Im soaking it in kerosene
Light em up and watch them burn teach them what they need to learn ha
Dirty hands aint made for shaking aint a rule that aint worth breaking
Well Im giving up on love cause loves given up on me

Now I dont hate the one who left
You cant hate someone whos dead
Hes out there holding on to someone Im holding up my smoking gun
Ill find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well Im giving up on love cause loves given up on me
Well Im giving up on love hey loves given up on me
Said I was in my early s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days lookin at the xrays
Talkin bout the options and talkin bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
Hows it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

I went sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasnt
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin fishing
Wasnt such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what Id do
If I could do it all again
And then

I went sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

Like tomorrow was a gift and youve got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it what can
I do with with it what would I do with it

Sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
Shed trade Colorado if hed take her with him
Closes the door fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
Shes answered by the taillights shinin through the window pane

He said I want to see you again
But Im stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said youre ramblin man
And you aint ever gonna change
Youve got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin
And in the waitress eyes he sees the same old light is shinin
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said I want to see you again
But Im stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said youre ramblin man
And you aint ever gonna change
Youve got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin
Born for leavin

Well its a windin road
When youre in the lost and found
Youre a lover Im a runner
And we go round and round
And I love you but I leave you
I dont want you but I need you
You know its you that calls me back here baby

Oh I want to see you again
But Im stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
Cause Im a ramblin man
I aint ever gonna change
Ive got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin
Born for leavin

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin pines
Im with your ghost again
Its a shame about the weather
But I know soon well be together
And I cant wait til then
I cant wait til then
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin there on that lawn
Discount shades store bought tan
Flip flops and cutoff jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
Im on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And were were just getting started
I was singin to you you were singin to me
I was so alive never been more free
Fired up my daddys lighter and we sang
Ooohh
Stayed there til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin dont go
When I think about you I think about 
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldnt even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet thered still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didnt care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though youre a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me do you think about 
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woah Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Driving through town
Just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldnt have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went aflying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with S and I was concerned
So I said Son now where did you learn to talk like that

He said Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So Ive been watching you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said Lord please help me help my stupid self
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my sons Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said Son now whered you learn to pray like that

He said Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mamas hand
Yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So Ive been watching you

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said My little bear is growing up
He said But when Im big Ill still know what to do

Cause Ive been watching you dad aint that cool
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then Ill be as strong as superman
Well be just alike hey wont we dad
When I can do everything you do
Cause Ive been watching you
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a twolane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
Thats the truth

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin
Small town nights need both ends burnin
Shades need drawin hearts need fallin
Boots need knockin knockin boots
Knockin boots me and you oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need aslingin
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishin in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin
Small town nights need both ends burnin
Shades need drawin hearts need fallin
Boots need knockin knockin boots
Knockin boots girl me and you

Doors need shuttin
Lights need cuttin
Lips need lockin
Boots need knockin

And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishin in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin
Small town nights need both ends burnin
Shades need drawin hearts need fallin
Boots need knockin knockin boots
Mmm knockin boots me and you oh
Knockin boots
Dont you dare go runnin down my little town where I grew up
And I wont cuss your city lights
If you aint ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

We may live our lives a little slower
But that dont mean I wouldnt be proud to show ya

Where I come from
Theres an old plow boy out turnin up dirt
Where I come from
Theres a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin lot
No nobodys gonna call the cops
Where I come from

See that door right there man I swear that it aint never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin chair at the courthouse square Ill tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills

Dont let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin

Where I come from
Theres a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah Im pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

Where I come from
Theres a big ol moon shinin down at night
Where I come from
Theres a man done wrong gonna make it right

Where I come from
Theres an old plow boy out turnin up dirt
Where I come from
Theres a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin lot
No aint nobody gonna call the cops

Yeah that river runs across that old flint rock
Where I come from
Where I come from
She left without leaving a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured shed gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If youre calling bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night Im bowling
If youve got something to sell
Youre wasting your time Im not buying
If its anybody else wait for the tone
You know what to do
And PS if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldnt believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didnt know what shed say
But she heard three rings and then

If its Friday night Im at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday if it dont rain
Im headed out to the lake
And Ill be gone all weekend long
But Ill call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And PS if this is Austin
I still love you

Well this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If youre calling bout my heart its still yours
I shouldve listened to it a little more
Then it wouldnt have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine youre talking to
Cant you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

Verse 
I turn the TV off to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself anything to make a sound
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Verse 
You can say were done the way you always do
Its easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends you know theyre gonna say
Were bad for each other but we aint good for anyone else
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Bridge
We dont have to miss each other come over
We dont have to fix each other come over
We dont have to say forever come over
You dont have to stay forever come over
Chorus
I told you I wouldnt call I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over come over come over come over come over
Outro
Come over come over come over come over come over
Come over come over come over come over come over
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts made the start it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed disassembled rearranged
We came together fell apart
And broke each others hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love we found trust
Vowed wed never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn back its just a steppin stone
To where we are
Where weve been
Said wed do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We wont be sad well be glad
For all the life weve had
And well remember when
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a ninepound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in fourwheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hoodsliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddys in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a comeandgetme grin
And like a bullet we were gone again cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking
Last updated  PM MST
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the roadside
Went to high school here got that Panther pride
Shell be cheering them on every Friday night

She couldnt hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldnt help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 
But she never forgot where she came from

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mammas mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
Shes a good girl but shes not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Shes got an old soul shes the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what its worth
Theres a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But theres nothing like the one right across the street

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
Ive been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Looking forward to it for some time

And you know I love showin you off

Dancin in the candle light glow

And your hand drawin hearts on mine

And all I can think about is gettin you home

In a tavern
Or in a honkytonk
Or on a fourwheeldrive tailgate
Oh Ive got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me
But I dont give a rip
Ill stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

Cause Im a redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
Im just a product of my raisin
I say hey yall and yeehaw
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song

Out there keeping it country

Hell yeah

Victorias Secret

On a Walmart shelf halfprice
And still look sexy sexy
Just as sexy as those models on TV

To make my man want me
You may think Im trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods

Got a girl from the south side got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by man I bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin  in a  I aint in no hurry
Ima take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans she dont need no belt
But I can turn them inside out I dont need no help
Got hips like honey so thick and so sweet man
It aint no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin  in a  I aint in no hurry
Ima take it slow just as fast as I can

Were out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin  in a  I aint in no hurry
Ima take it slow just as fast as I can

Ima take it slow
Just as fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Got braids in her hair
Theres a new wind blowing like Ive never known
Im breathing deeper than Ive ever done
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
And I am letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
Ive forgiven myself for the mistakes Ive made
Now theres just one thing the only thing I wanna do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you

Yeah I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know theres nothing in this world I cant do

I used to run in circles going nowhere fast
Id take uh one step forward and two steps back
Couldnt walk a straight line even if I wanted to
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
Whoa here we go now
Hey I wanna love ya baby

Yeah I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know theres nothing in this world I cant do

Sometimes its hard for me to understand
But youre teaching me to be a better man
I dont wanna take this life for granted like I used to do no no
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
Im ready to love somebody
Love somebody like you Ooh
And I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you yeah
Oh yeah
Hey I wanna love ya baby

I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found its way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah
Hey I wanna be that
Heading down south to the land of the pines
Im thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And Im ahoping for Raleigh I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar I pick a banjo now
Oh north country winters keep agetting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I aint turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But hes a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that shes the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water thats no longer runnin under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank Im So Lonesome I Could Cry
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Ill be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Ill be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Neon lights flashing bright til youre almost hypnotized
Waitress short skirt gets hit on by every guy
Comin and goin always rollin with the flow
Bartender pour our drinks Cdigo do a shot
You think youre tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says youre not
You step outside thinkin youre gonna show em you are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Well be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Well be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And thats home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house its not much to talk about
But its filled with love thats grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love

Its funny how its the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
Theres no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This Ive come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love


I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we dont have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well Ive done seen the sun rise
See the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
Its just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they dont understand
Is its the miles that make a man
I wouldnt trade that thing in for a rocket
What they dont know is my dad and me
We drove her out to Tennessee
And shes still here and now hes gone
So I hold on

Its just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably dont look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah thats what makes it sound so good
To me its better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on

To the things I believe in
My faith your love our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah I hold on I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I cant change who I am right or wrong
So I hold on

Yeah baby looking at you right now
There aint never been no doubt
Without you Id be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me baby
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on

To the things I believe in
My faith your love our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah I hold on I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I cant change who I am right or wrong
So I hold on
Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she aint a fooling me

She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

We ride back and forth til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said shes got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

Well she isnt into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere man her eyes light up

She thinks my tractors
She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy
She thinks my tractors sexy
She thinks my tractors sexy
I I been gone
Been gone too long singing my songs on the road
Another town one more show and Im coming home
Dont give a damn what these keys are for
Im gonna knock down that front door and
Ima find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since its felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby like a wrecking ball
You look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day and
That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I wont be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
Im gonna rock you baby like a wrecking ball
That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rocking foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby like a wrecking ball
Bet your windows rolled down and your hairs pulled back
And I bet you got no idea youre going way too fast
Youre trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop til you get where you goin
Youre trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway wont hold you tonight
The highway dont know youre alive
The highway dont care if youre all alone
But I do I do
The highway wont dry your tears
The highway dont need you here
The highway dont care if youre coming home
But I do I do

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah I bet youre bending Gods ear talking bout me
Youre trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
Youre trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway wont hold you tonight
The highway dont know youre alive
The highway dont care if youre all alone
But I do I do
The highway wont dry your tears
The highway dont need you here
The highway dont care if youre coming home
But I do I do

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby baby

The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I cant live without I cant live without you baby oh baby
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
The highway dont care
But I do I do

I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
I see the sunrise creepin in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then shes gone again and

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller

My heartbeats rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller

When Im gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
Swear one Bud Light sip and I buzz back
One Jack and Diane and Im in the past
Lost in the middle of seventeen
Yeah everything about you and me

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song

I still see your hand out on the wind
That dashboard blue on your skin
That fire that touch that wild that rush
Yeah that was us running down a high
Wish all it took to go back in time

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song

That fire that touch that wild that rush
That high that Im still on
Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
Was a tank a gas and a radio song

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

No doubt her closet floor is under a pile of clothes
By now shes tried on everything she owns

She aint moved on yet
Man shes starting to
Im just saying if I know her like I think I do

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldnt be surprised if shes somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots

Im sure some cover band is wearing out her song
I bet that drink in her hand aint gonna last that long
Whoever shes there with is spinning her around
Shes probably a hot mess making a mess of me right now

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldnt be surprised if shes somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots

Yeah I dont know what shes doing now
But if I had to bet id throw my money down
On those high heeled shoes dancing with someone new

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldnt be surprised if shes somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots
Dancing with new boots
Dancing with some new boots
Whooo umm yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We wont hesitate
To break down the garden gate
Theres not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouvers lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
There was a distance between you and I between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh yeah
There aint no load that I cant hold
The roads are rough this I know
Ill be there when the light comes in
Just tell them were survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If youre going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If youre going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If youre going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah
A farmer and a teacher a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers cant stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why theres not four of them heaven only knows
I guess its not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
Its what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest a home and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young sons heart
And that teacher left her wisdom
In the minds of lots of children
Did her best to give em all a better start
And that preacher whispered
Cant you see the Promised Land
As he laid his bloodstained bible
In that hookers hand

There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why theres not four of them heaven only knows
I guess its not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
Its what you leave behind you when you go

Thats the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that bloodstained bible up
For all of us to see
He said Bless the farmer and the teacher an the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mamma
Who read it to me

There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why theres not four of them now I guess we know
Its not what you take when you leave this world behind you
Its what you leave behind you when you go

There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But theyre worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But its worth making
Dont let some Hellbent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone

High Tide or Low Tide
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
Told him just how our story ends
Did all I could to try to make it work
But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

Ive been at the house climbin them walls
Checkin that calendar xin days off
Hit another bar call another friend
Throw a few down tell the story again

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Im finally gettin out back into the world
Life is good I met me a girl
She got a beautiful heart eyes are blue
I dont hardly ever think about you

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
Sometimes I break down and cry

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
It dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
Doublewide Quick Stop midnight Ttop
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin up red dust
Pickin us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA no AC in the vents

We were Jesus saved me blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin front seat leanin
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin up in little pink houses
Makin out on living room couches
Blowin that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but were all alright

Baptist church parkin lot tryin not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin it to second base but sayin you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sisters got a boyfriend Daddy doesnt like
Now hes sittin out back  in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

We were Jesus saved me blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin front seat leanin
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin up in little pink houses
Makin out on living room couches
Blowin that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but were all alright
We were Jesus saved me blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin front seat leanin
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin up in little pink houses
Makin out on living room couches
Blowin that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but were all alright
American girls and American guys
Well always stand up and salute well always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying theres a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard til the day that he died
He wanted my mother my brother my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue

Oh justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And youll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause well put a boot in your ass its the American way

Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue

Oh oh
Of the red white and blue
Oh oh
Of my red white and blue
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window til its all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door blown away
Til theres nothing left standing nothing left of yesterday
Every tearsoaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screamin out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window til its all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door blown away
Til theres nothing left standing nothing left of yesterday
Every tearsoaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window til its all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door blown away
Til theres nothing left standing nothing left of yesterday
Every tearsoaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldnt get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
And I just laughed and said you all get in

She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I dont care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as Im with you it really dont matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if youd rather
Ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as Im with you it really dont matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if youd rather
Ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust of the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me hell yeah

You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if youd rather
Ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Oh yeah we can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor
I probably shouldnt have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I shouldve left it alone
When I caught you looking

A little smile a little how you been
A little touch a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

But after a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh after a few

We always take it way too far
Where its too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that well be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
Cause it happens every time

After a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah after a few

Little smile little how you been
Little touch little reminisce
We both know how it ends

After a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh after a few
When it rains it pours
But you didnt even notice
It aint rainin anymore
Its hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin above the risin water line

Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin
But youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

If you could see what I see
Youd be blinded by the colors
Yellow red and orange and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat take off your coat and take a look around

Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin
But youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

Oh tie up the boat take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now

Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin
But youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
Let go of your umbrella
Cause darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head
Yeah theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

Itll all be alright
I can
See you over there starin at your drink
Watchin that ice sink all alone tonight
And
Chances are youre sittin here in this bar
Cause he aint gonna treat you right
Well its
Probably not my place but Im gonna say it anyway
Cause you look like
You
Havent felt the fire had a little fun
Hadnt had a smile in a little while baby

Blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin on the wall
But darlin it dont match your eyes

Baby blue aint your color

Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up tryna take you home
But I just
I dont understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well Ive
Had enough to drink and its makin me think
That I just might
Tell you
If I were a painter I wouldnt change ya
Id just paint you bright baby

Cause blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin on the wall
But darlin it dont match your eyes
Im tellin you
You dont need that guy
Its so black and white hes stealin your thunder
Baby blue aint your color

No no no

But darlin it dont match your eyes
Im tellin you
You dont need that guy
Its so black and white hes stealin your thunder
Baby blue aint your color
Blue aint your color

Mmm no no no baby
Come here baby
Let me light up your world
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in LA
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who dont know
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below
Did you burst out with pride for the red white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters

Im just a singer of simple songs
Im not a real political man
I watch CNN but Im not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate
Did you feel guilty because youre a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her
Did you dust off that Bible at home
Did you open your eyes hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun
Did you turn off that violent old movie youre watching
And turn on I Love Lucy reruns
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love

Im just a singer of simple songs
Im not a real political man
I watch CNN but Im not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love
Im just a singer of simple songs
Im not a real political man
I watch CNN but Im not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love Id known
But you rescued me from reachin for the bottom
And brought me back from bein too far gone

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Ive looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottles always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didnt waste it
Cause theres nothing like your love to get me high

And youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time


Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
Bet you think Im sitting at home naw
Bet you think that Im all alone naw
I bet you think Im missing you and wishing you would call my phone

Sipping something strong

And she got me like you aint never got me

Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave Cause I know

Got a good looking woman with her arms round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
Ive got everything I need and nothing that I dont
Homegrown

Sip whiskey out the bottle living like well never die

Our own way
At my place far away

Hanging off your shoulder

Smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want I got what you need

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That dont bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
Im not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend Im okay
But thats not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin so much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing
What couldve been
And not seein that love in you
Is what I was tryin to do

Its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But Im doin It
Its hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and Im alone
Still harder
Gettin up gettin dressed livin with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin so much to say much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing
What couldve been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do oh


What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin so much to say much to say
And watchin you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do oh

Not seeing that love in you
Thats what I was trying to do
I feel no shame
Im proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul
In the boondocks
I can feel that
Muddy water running through my veins
I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar

I feel no shame
Im proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

I can taste that honeysuckle
And its still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowing

I feel no shame
Im proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

Its where I learned about living
Its where I learned about love
Its where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough
Its where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me
This is who I am
Give me a tin roof a front porch and a gravel road
And that is home to me feels like home to me

I feel no shame
Im proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

You get a line Ill get a pole
Well go fishing in the craw fish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning
If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Ohoh Ohho

Lord make me a rainbow Ill shine down on my mother
Shell know Im safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life aint always what you think it ought to be no
Aint even gray but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

And Ill be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
Im as green as the ring on my little cold finger
Ive never known the lovin of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin my hand
Theres a boy here in town says hell love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

So put on your best boys and Ill wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughtsoh no Ill sell em for a dollar
Theyre worth so much more after Im a goner
And maybe then youll hear the words Ive been singin
Funny when youre dead how people start listenin

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh ooh the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep em in your pocket
Save em for a time when youre really gonna need em
Oh the sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time
So put on your best boys and Ill wear my pearls
He was sittin there his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced upon the sand
With every stroke he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean against the mornin sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars Ill paint you anything

Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it early spring
For a while shell be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

He looked at me with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush and said to me
Son just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if theres any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again

Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it early spring
For a while shell be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

Paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin all the way around

Cotton dress make it early spring
For a while shell be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

Oh paint me a Birmingham
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin for the phone cause
I cant fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without

Another shot of whiskey
Cant stop lookin at the door
Wishing youd come sweeping
In the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without

She dont throw any tshirt on and walk to a bar
She dont text her friends and say I gotta get laid tonight
She dont say Its okay I never loved him anyway
She dont scroll through her phone just looking for a BandAid

Its different for girls when their hearts get broke
They cant tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They dont take someone home and act like its nothing
They cant just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
But its different for girls

She dont sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She dont have the luxury to let herself go
She wont call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough yeah the guys they can just act tough

Its different for girls when their hearts get broke
They cant tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They dont take someone home and act like its nothing
They cant just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
But its different for girls

Its different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears they cant pretend it was never there

A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough yeah the guys they can just act tough
So tough
Its different for girls
Its different for girls
Right now hes probably slow dancing
With a bleachedblond tramp
And shes probably getting frisky
Right now hes probably buying her some fruity little drink
Cause she cant shoot whiskey
Right now hes probably up behind her with a poolstick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he dont know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time hell think before he cheats

Right now shes probably up singing some
Whitetrash version of Shania karaoke
Right now shes probably saying Im drunk
And hes a thinking that hes gonna get lucky
Right now hes probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom cologne
Oh and he dont know

Oh that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time hell think before he cheats

I mightve saved a little trouble for the next girl
Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh you know it wont be on me
No not on me

Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time hell think before he cheats

Oh maybe next time hell think before he cheats
Oh before he cheats
Oh
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect AllAmerican girl
Wouldnt touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night riding shotgun in my car
Wed go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didnt know any better
Didnt have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin that  to 
Dreamin of the days when you were in my arms I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin spent my nights drinkin
Howlin at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldnt come too soon
Couldnt come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didnt work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

Im gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better we could have a real nice life
Cause Im what you wanted youre what I need
So lets meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me
Theres somethin bout a truck in a farmers field
A No trespass sign and time to kill
Nobodys gonna get hurt so whats the big deal
Theres somethin bout a truck in a farmers field

And theres somethin bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
Theres somethin bout beer sittin on ice

And theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmers field Hah will make a boy a mess
Theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress

And theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
The most natural thing youve ever felt before
Theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more

And theres somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck

Theres somethin bout a creek around  AM
After a few of those beers you wanna dive on in
You dont need no clothes so just hang em on a limb
Theres somethin bout a creek around  AM

And theres somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
Hah
Street lights along the highway
Throwin shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute

Theres a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think youre goin down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute
I have to find myself a new coffee shop
I have to find another Friday night spot
Cause if I see somebody Id have to talk
And Ive got nothin to say nothin to say

Its not like I forgot places we went
But now theyre monuments to what I thought it meant
So Ive been startin over ever since
We went our separate ways

Now Im a tourist in this town
So where do I go from here
A tourist in this town
A broken heart for a souvenir

Lookin in windows I dont recognize
Like I aint been livin here for my whole life
Walkin the tears away wastin the night
Nothin better to do cause it all looks like you

Im a tourist in this town
So where do I go from here
A tourist in this town
A broken heart for a souvenir
Once was found but now Im lost
Dont even know the name of that street I crossed
Im a tourist in this town
So where do I go from here

You turned my home into a city on a map
Im okay alone but the thing that makes me mad
Is I feel like a stranger like the only thing I am

Is a tourist in this town
So where do I go from here
A tourist in this town
A broken heart for a souvenir
Once was found but now Im lost
Dont even know the name of that street I crossed
Im a tourist in this town
So where do I go from here

A broken heart for a souvenir
So where do I go from here
Girl I know I dont know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
Im so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is its going good

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know that the rising sun
Aint no good for me
Cause youll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 
Theres plenty of gas and the nights still alive

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

Every time we have to say goodbye

Every touch is like the strongest drug
I dont know how much longer I can go

I never had something that I cant walk away from
But girl my selfcontrols so paralyzed
When it comes to you no I aint got no patience

I graduated with  sheep I was the black one
If there was a reputation to be out in this town I had the bad one
I was born in the wrong place in the wrong time
But sometimes the wrong way makes you the right kind

Grand pappy told my pappy back in my day son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
Well all meet back at the local saloon
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
Weve got too much corruption too much crime in the streets
Its time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and hell settle them down
You can bet hell set them down cause

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
Well all meet back at the local saloon
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men beer for my horses
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys

She looks great in anything
Shes I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
Shes I cant find a thing to wear
Now and then shes moody

Shes a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair ablowing
Shes a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
Shes a warm conversation
That I wouldnt miss for nothing
Shes a fighter when shes mad
And shes a lover when shes loving

And shes everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
Cause shes everything to me

Shes a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
Shes a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause its Monday
Shes a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
Shes a one glass of wine
And shes feeling kinda tipsy

Shes the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
Shes a picture in my wallet
And my unborn childrens mother
Shes the hand that Im holding
When Im on my knees and praying
Shes the answer to my prayer
And shes the song that Im playing

And shes everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
Cause shes everything to me

Shes the voice I love to hear
Someday when Im ninety
Shes that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah shes the one
That Id lay down my own life for

And shes everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
Shes everything to me
Yeah shes everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
Shes everything to me
Theres a little moonlight dancing on the sand
Theres a warm breeze blowing by the ocean as youre taking my hand
You need to know where Im standing now
That Im right on the edge of giving in to ya
Baby its a long way down

If I fall can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that youre going to treat it right
Im barely hanging on
If I fall can you let me down easy

The scent of your perfume floating in the air
Looking like an angel lying on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss I know whatll happen
Ill be at the mercy of you

If I fall can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that youre going to treat it right
Im barely hanging on
If I fall can you let me down easy
If I fall can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that youre going to treat it right
Im barely hanging on
If I fall can you let me down easy

Ezekiel  The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men  Blessed is
he who in the name of charity and
good will shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness for he is
truly his brothers keeper and the
finder of lost children And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you

himself a smoke
After a second of watching him 
MIA

MIA
Oh Well in that case will you roll

her lips Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincents
hand He lights it
MIA

Think nothing of it
He begins rolling one for himself

making everything SHAKE and RATTLE Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal The entire restaurant applauds
Back to Mia and Vincent
MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam
VINCENT
Sure did I heard you did a pilot
MIA
That was my fifteen minutes
VINCENT
What was it
MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five
VINCENT
What
MIA
Fox Force Five Fox as in were a
bunch of foxy chicks Force as in
were a force to be reckoned with
Five as in theres one two 
three four five of us There
was a blonde one Sommerset ONeal
from that show Baton Rouge she
was the leader A Japanese one a
black one a French one and a brunette
one me  We all had special skills
Sommerset had a photographic memory
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master
the black girl was a demolition
expert the French fox specialty
was sex
VINCENT
What was your specialty
MIA
Knives The character I played Raven
McCoy her background was she was
raised by circus performers So she
grew up doing a knife act According
to the show she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife But
because she grew up in a circus she
was also something of an acrobat
She could do illusions she was a
trapeze artist  when youre keeping
the world safe from evil you never
know when being a trapeze artists
gonna come in handy And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather
an old vaudevillian taught her If
we woulda got picked up they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke
VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes
MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one cause we only did one show
VINCENT
Tell me
MIA
No Its really corny
VINCENT
Cmon dont be that way
MIA
No You wont like it and Ill be
embarrassed
VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you cant tell it to me
I promise I wont laugh
MIA
laughing
Thats what Im afraid of
VINCENT
Thats not what I meant and you know
it
MIA
Youre quite the silver tongue devil

VINCENT
I meant I wouldnt laugh at you
MIA
Thats not what you said Vince Well

good milk shake

dollars but its pretty fuckin
good
He slides the shake back
Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens
MIA
Dont you hate that
VINCENT
What
MIA
Uncomfortable silences Why do we
feel its necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable
VINCENT
I dont know
MIA
Thats when you know you found
somebody special When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute and
comfortably share silence
VINCENT
I dont think were there yet But
dont feel bad we just met each
other
MIA
Well Ill tell you what Ill go to
the bathroom and powder my nose
while you sit here and think of
something to say
VINCENT

INT JACKRABBIT SLIMS DINING AREA  NIGHT
Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak As he chews his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant
Mia comes back to the table
MIA
Dont you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you
VINCENT

Holly doesnt seem to be much of a
waiter We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroes section
MIA
Which one theres two Marilyn
Monroes
VINCENT
No theres not
Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table
VINCENT
Thats Marilyn Monroe
Then pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS 
VINCENT
 and thats Mamie Van Doren I
dont see Jayne Mansfield so it
must be her night off
MIA
Pretty smart
VINCENT
I have moments
MIA
Did ya think of something to say
VINCENT
Actually theres something Ive
wanted to ask you about but you
seem like a nice person and I didnt
want to offend you
MIA
Oooohhhh this doesnt sound like
mindless boring gettingtoknow
you chitchat This sounds like you
actually have something to say
VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended
MIA
You cant promise something like
that I have no idea what youre
gonna ask You could ask me what
youre gonna ask me and my natural
response could be to be offended
Then through no fault of my own I
woulda broken my promise
VINCENT
Then lets just forget it
MIA
That is an impossibility Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility
VINCENT
Is that a fact
Mia nods her head Yes
MIA
Besides its more exciting when you
dont have permission
VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan
MIA
Whos Antwan
VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror
MIA
He fell out of a window
VINCENT
Thats one way to say it Another
way is he was thrown out Another
was is he was thrown out by
Marsellus And even another way is
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you
MIA
Is that a fact
VINCENT
No its not its just what I heard
MIA
Who told you this
VINCENT
They
Mia and Vincent smile
MIA
They talk a lot dont they
VINCENT
They certainly do
MIA
Well dont by shy Vincent what
exactly did they say
Vincent is slow to answer
MIA
Let me help you Bashful did it
involve the Fword
VINCENT
No They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage
MIA
And
VINCENT
No and thats it
MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a fourstory window because
he massaged my feet
VINCENT
Yeah
MIA
And you believed that
VINCENT
At the time I was told it seemed
reasonable
MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable
VINCENT
No it seemed excessive But that
doesnt mean it didnt happen I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you
MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wifes feet is something else
VINCENT
But did it happen
MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he shook
it I met Anwan once  at my wedding
 then never again  The truth is
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror But when you scamps get
together youre worse than a sewing
circle

Mia moves to her CD player thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one kd lang The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number which Mia plays airguitar to She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincents
overcoat hanging on the rack She touches its sleeve It
feels good
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch
Like a little girl playing cowboy she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper Imitating what he did earlier licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette Maybe a
little too fat but not bad for a first try Mia thinks so
anyway Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter She SLAPS the lighter against her leg
trying to light it fancystyle like Vince did What do you
know she did it Mias one happy clam She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke lighting it up
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed
The Miamade cigarette is brought up to her lips and she
takes a long cool drag Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket But wait her fingers touch something
else Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance
Wearing a big smile Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face

ready for whatevers waiting for him on the other side of
that door So he goes through it
LIVING ROOM
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll Shes twisted on her back Blood and puke are
down her front And her face is contorted Not out of the
tightness of pain but just the opposite the muscles in her
face are so relaxed she lies still with her mouth wide open
Slackjawed
VINCENT
OH Jesus Christ
Jesus Fuckin Christ
Oh Fuck me
Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mias fallen body
Bending down where she lays he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse She slightly stirs
Mia is aware of Vincent over her speaking to her
VINCENT
sounding weird
Mia MIA What the hell happened
But shes unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles
but theyre not distinctive enough to be called words
Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story
VINCENT
to himself
Ill be a sonofabitch

Mia is incapable of answering He SLAPS her face hard
Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat hanging on the
rack
He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY Its gone Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia We follow

yelling to Mia
Okay honey were getting you on
your feet
He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection

a big red dot on Mias body where her heart is
VINCENT
Okay what do I do
LANCE
Well youre giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart
But shes got a breast plate in front
of her heart so you gotta pierce
through that So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion
Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion which looks like The
Shape killing its victims in HALLOWEEN
VINCENT
I gotta stab her
LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart you gotta stab
her hard
Then once you do push down on the plunger
VINCENT

Were in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra California in the year  BUTCHS MOTHER ish
stands in the doorway leading into the living room Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer The CAMERA is the perspective of a fiveyear old
boy
MOTHER
Butch stop watching TV a second We
got a special visitor Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a POW camp
BUTCH OS
Uhhuh
MOTHER
Well this here is Capt Koons He
was in the POW camp with Daddy
CAPT KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boys
eyeline When Koons speaks he speaks with a slight Texas
accent
CAPT KOONS
Hello little man Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you See I was a good
friend of your Daddys We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together  Hopefully youll
never have to experience this
yourself but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were for as long as we were you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other If it had been me who had
not made it Major Coolidge would be
talkin right now to my son Jim But
the way it worked out is Im talkin
to you Butch I got somethin for
ya
The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket
CAPT KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your greatgranddaddy
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville Tennessee It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris It
was your greatgranddaddys war watch
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches You see up until
then people just carried pocket
watches Your greatgranddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war Then when he had done his duty
he went home to your great
grandmother took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol coffee
can And in that can it stayed til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again This time they called it World
War Two Your greatgranddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck
Unfortunately Danes luck wasnt as
good as his old mans Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin that island alive So
three days before the Japanese took
the island your year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki a man
he had never met before in his life
to deliver to his infant son who he
had never seen in the flesh his
gold watch Three days later your
grandfather was dead But Winocki
kept his word After the war was
over he paid a visit to your
grandmother delivering to your infant
father his Dads gold watch This
watch This watch was on your Daddys
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch itd
be confiscated The way your Daddy
looked at it that watch was your
birthright And hed be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boys
birthright So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin
His ass Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass Then when he
died of dysentery he gave me the
watch I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years
Then after seven years I was sent
home to my family And now little
man I give the watch to you
Capt Koons hands the watch to Butch A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it

pot belly If I had one Id wear a
teeshirt two sizes too small to

it

fists as he drives down the street
BUTCH
Of all the fuckin things she coulda

EXT CITY STREET  DAY
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it
CUT TO
A parking meter red flag rises up then out leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY
Butch isnt completely reckless He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin through the front door
EXT ALLEY  DAY
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street
then he discreetly glances out
EXT STREET  BUTCHS APARTMENT  DAY
Everything seems normal More or less the right number of
cars in the street None of the parked cars appear out of
place None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside
Basically it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butchs home
Butch peers around a wall taking in the vital information
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard
Across the street from Butchs building on the corner is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant A big sign
sticks up in the air with the name Teriyaki Donut and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice
EXT BUTCHS APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building Once again everything appears normal  the laundry
room the pool his apartment door  nothing appears
disturbed
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment number 
He steps outside the door and listens inside Nothing
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door quietly opening
it
INT BUTCHS APARTMENT  DAY
His apartment hasnt been touched
He cautiously steps inside shuts the door and takes a quick
look around Obviously no one is there
Butch walks into his modest kitchen and opens the
refrigerator
He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it
With carton in hard Butch surveys the apartment Then he
goes to the bedroom
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat clean
and anonymous The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies an Olympic silver medal a framed issue
of Ring Magazine with Butch on the cover and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo
Sure enough theres the watch just like he said it was On
the bedside table hanging on his little kangaroo statue
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts Putting
down the milk he opens the box takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster
Butch glances to his right his eyes fall on something
What he sees is a small compact Czech M submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it lying on his kitchen counter
BUTCH
softly
Holy shit
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it
Then a toilet FLUSHES
Butch looks up to the bathroom door which is parallel to
the kitchen There is someone behind it
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch Butch freezes not
knowing what to do
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom tightening his belt In his hand is the book
MODESTY BLAISE by Peter ODonnell
Vincent and Butch lock eyes
Vincent freezes
Butch doesnt move except to point the M in Vincents
direction
Neither man opens his mouth
Then the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts
Thats all the situation needed
Butchs finger HITS the trigger
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger Vincent
is annihilated
Butch stands frozen amazed at what just happened His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip
With the respect it deserves Butch carefully places the M
back on the kitchen counter
Then he exits the apartment quickly
EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY
Butch not running but walking very rapidly crosses the
courtyard
comes out of the apartment building crosses the street
goes through the alley
and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT
EXT HONDA  DAY
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face
EXT APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building
INT HONDA  DAY
Butch looks out the window at his former home
BUTCH
Thats how youre gonna beat em
Butch  They keep underestimatin

This makes the boxer laugh out loud As he laughs he flips
a tape in the cassette player When the MUSIC starts he
SINGS along with it
He drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut
Butch is still chuckling singing along with the song as we
see
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The big man himself Marsellus Wallace exit Teriyaki Donut
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee He steps off the curb crossing the street
in front of Butchs car This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him
When Marsellus is in front of Butchs car he casually glances
to his left sees Butch continues walking then STOPS
DOUBLETAKE Am I really seeing what Im seeing
Butch doesnt wait for the big man to answer his own question
He STOMPS on the gas pedal
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus sending him the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROADSIDED by a gold
Camaro Z BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabiennes Honda Blood flows from his
nostrils The stillfunctional tape player continues to play
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside
PEDESTRIAN
Jesus are you okay
Butch look at him spacedout
BUTCH
I guess
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street GAWKERS
gather around the body
GAWKER 
to the others
Hes dead Hes dead
This jerks yelling makes Marsellus come to
TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet
GAWKER 
If you need a witness in court Ill
be glad to help He was a drunken
maniac He hit you and crashed into
that car
MARSELLUS
still incoherent
Who
GAWKER 
pointing at Butch
Him
Marsellus follows the Gawkers finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street looking a shambles
MARSELLUS
Well Ill be damned
The big man takes out a  Automatic and the Gawkers back
away
Marsellus starts moving toward Butch
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly beeline toward
him
BUTCH
Sacre bleu
Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES but hes so hurt
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild
He HITS a LOOKYLOO WOMAN in the hip She falls to the ground
screaming
LOOKYLOO WOMAN
Oh my God Ive been shot
Thats all Butch needs to see Hes outta here
Marsellus RUNS after him
The CROWD looks agape
Butch is in a mad limping RUN
The big mans hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads MASONDIXIE PAWNSHOP
INT MASONDIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY
MAYNARD a hillbillylookin boy stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when all of a sudden chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world
MAYNARD

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation than stands
next to the door
MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute

Before Maynard can finish his threat Marsellus CHARGES in
He doesnt get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus face
The gangsters feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back
Outside two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by
Butch POUNCES on the fallen body PUNCHING him twice more in
the face
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus hand than grabs ahold
of his middle finger
BUTCH
So you like chasing people huh
He BREAKS the finger Marsellus lets out a pain sound  Butch
then places the barrel of the  between his eyes PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter
BUTCH
Well guess what big man you caught

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard whos brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun aimed at the two men
BUTCH

MAYNARD
Now you on top stand up and come to

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter As soon as he
gets there Maynard HAULS OFF HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun knocking Butch down and out
After Butch goes down Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone
Marsellus Wallace from his position on the floor groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings Then it picks up
MAYNARD

Marsellus passes out
FADE TO BLACK

INT PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY
TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
They are tied up in two separate chairs In their mouths are
two SMstyle ball gags a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths Both men are
unconscious
Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until theyre wide awake and wet as otters The two
prisoners look up at their captors
Maynard stands in front of them fire extinguisher in one
hand shotgun in the other and Marsellus  sticking in
his belt
MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed
A BUZZER buzzes
MAYNARD
Thats Zed
Without saying another word Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them
WE HEAR on the other side of the curtains Maynard let Zed
inside the store
Butch and Marsellus look around the room The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon After taking
in their predicament Butch and Marsellus look at each other
all traces of hostility gone replaced by a terror they both
share at what theyve gotten themselves into
Maynard and ZED come through the curtains Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard if such a thing is possible
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull Zed is a deadly cobra Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives He inspects them for a
long time then says
ZED
to Maynard
You said you waited for me
MAYNARD
I did
ZED
Then how come theyre all beat up
MAYNARD
They did that to each other They
was fightin when they came in This

ZED

MAYNARD
Then shell be fine
ZED
Bring out The Gimp
MAYNARD
I think The Gimps sleepin
ZED
Well I guess youll just wake em
up then wont you
Maynard opens a trap door in the floor
MAYNARD
yelling in the hole
Wake up
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash
He gives it a rough yank and from below the floor rises
THE GIMP
The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear There are zippers buckles and studs
here and there on the body On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper closed for a mouth
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog
Zed takes the chair sits it in front of the two prisoners
then lowers into it Maynard hands The Gimps leash to Zed
then backs away
MAYNARD
to The Gimp
Down
The Gimp gets on its knees
Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men
MAYNARD
Whos first
ZED
I aint fer sure yet
Then with his little finger Zed does a silent Eenie meany
miney moe  just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two
Butch are Marsellus are terrified
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims
The Gimpss eyes go from one to the other inside the mask
Zed continues his silent singsong with his finger moving
left to right then it stops
TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
After a beat THE CAMERA MOVES to the right zeroing in on
Marsellus
Zed stands up
ZED
Wanna do it here
MAYNARD
Naw drag big boy to Russells old
room
Zed grabs Marsellus chair and DRAGS him into Russells old
room
Russell no doubt was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the MasonDixie pawnshop
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room a back room in the back of the
back room is empty
As Marsellus is dragged away he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russells old room
MAYNARD
to The Gimp
Up
The Gimp rises Maynard ties The Gimps leash to a hook on
the ceiling
MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one
The Gimp bows its head yes Maynard disappears into
Russells old room There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds singing in harmony fills the air
Butch looks at The Gimp The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy
From behind the door we hear country MUSIC struggling and
MAYNARD OS
Whoa this boys got a bit of fight
in em
We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus
ZED OS
You wanna fight You wanna fight
Good I like to fight
Butch pauses listens to the voices Then in a panic
hurriedly struggles to get free
The Gimp is laughing wildly
The ropes are on too tight and Butch cant break free
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room we hear
MAYNARD OS
Thats it thats it boy youre
goin fine Oooooooh just like
that thats good
grunting faster
Stay still stay still goddamn ya
Zed goddammit git over here and
hold em
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms Then quite
easily the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen
THE GIMP
Huhng
The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY trying to get the leash off the hook
He tries to yell but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts
Butch is out of his chair quickly dispensing three BOXERS
PUNCHES to its face The punches knock The Gimp out making
him fall to his knees this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook Butch removes the ball gag then
silently makes his way through the red curtains
INT PAWNSHOP  DAY
Butch sneaks to the door
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring Grabbing them hes about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus
Butch decides for the life of him he cant leave anybody in
a situation like that Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies heads in
with
He picks up a big destructivelooking hammer then discards
it Not destructive enough He picks up a chainsaw thinks
about it for a moment then puts it back Next a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size But then he spots
what hes been looking for
A Samurai sword
It hands in its handcarved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall next to a neon DADS OLDFASHIONED ROOT BEER sign
Butch takes the sword off the wall removing it from its
sheath Its a magnificent piece of steel It seems to glisten
in the lowwattage light of the pawnshop Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show Not
on your life Its as sharp as it gets This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs Holding the
sword pointed downward Takakura Kenstyle he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business
INT PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon
Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russells old room
INT RUSSELLS OLD ROOM  DAY
Butchs hand comes into frame pushing the door open It
swings open silently revealing the rapists who have switched
positions
Zed is now bent over Marsellus who is bent over a wooden
horse
Maynard watches Both have their backs to Butch
Maynard faces the CAMERA grinning while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword
Miserable violated and looking like a rag doll Marsellus
red ball gag still in mouth opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard His eyes widen
BUTCH
Hey hillbilly
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword
Butch SCREAMS with one mighty SWING SLASHES Maynard across
the front moving past him eyes and blade now locked on
Zed
Maynard stands trembling his front sliced open in shock
Butch while never taking his eyes off Zed THRUSTS the sword
behind him SKEWERING Maynard then EXTRACTS it pointing
the blade toward Zed Maynard COLLAPSES
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butchs sword to Marsellus  Automatic
which lies within reach
Butchs eyes follow Zeds
BUTCH
You want that gun Zed Pick it up
Zeds hand inches toward the weapon
Butch GRIPS the sword tighter
Zed studies Butch
Butch looks hard at Zed
Then a VOICE says
MARSELLUS OS
Step aside Butch
Butch steps aside REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him
holding Maynards pumpaction shotgun
KABOOM
Zed is BLASTED in the groin Down he goes SCREAMING in AGONY
Marsellus looking down at his whimpering rapist EJECTS the
used shotgun shell
Butch lowers the sword and hangs back Not a word until

fear on his face ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door
Then he listens to them talk

THE WOLF
Okay first thing you two

INT COFFEE SHOP  MORNING
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages which he eats with gusto
Jules on the other hand just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin He seems far away in thought The Waitress pours a
refill for both men
VINCENT
Thanks a bunch
to Jules whos
nursing his coffee
Want a sausage
JULES
Naw I dont eat pork
VINCENT
Are you Jewish
JULES
I aint Jewish man I just dont dig
on swine
VINCENT
Why not
JULES
Theyre filthy animals I dont eat
filthy animals
VINCENT
Sausages taste good Pork chops taste
good
JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie  Ill never know cause even if
it did I wouldnt eat the filthy
motherfucker Pigs sleep and root in
shit Thats a filthy animal I dont
wanna eat nothin that aint got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces
VINCENT
How about dogs Dogs eat their own
feces
JULES
I dont eat dog either
VINCENT
Yes but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal
JULES
I wouldnt go so far as to call a
dog filthy but theyre definitely
dirty But a dogs got personality
And personality goes a long way
VINCENT
So by that rationale if a pig had a
better personality hes cease to be
a filthy animal
JULES
Wed have to be talkin bout one
motherfuckin charmin pig Itd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs
The two men laugh
VINCENT
Good for you Lighten up a little
You been sittin there all quiet
JULES
I just been sittin here thinkin
VINCENT
mouthful of food
About what
JULES
The miracle we witnessed
VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed I witnessed
a freak occurrence
JULES
Do you know that a miracle is
VINCENT
An act of God
JULES
Whats an act of God
VINCENT
I guess its when God makes the
impossible possible And Im sorry
Jules but I dont think what happened
this morning qualifies
JULES
Dont you see Vince that shit dont
matter Youre judging this thing
the wrong way Its not about what
It could be God stopped the bullets
he changed Coke into Pepsi he found
my fuckin car keys You dont judge
shit like this based on merit Whether
or not what we experienced was an
accordingtoHoyle miracle is
insignificant What is significant
is I felt Gods touch God got
involved
VINCENT
But why
JULES
Thats whats fuckin wit me I
dont know why But I cant go back
to sleep
VINCENT
So youre serious youre really
gonna quit
JULES
The life most definitely
Vincent takes a bite of food Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the bg we see a PATRON call the Waitress
PATRON
Garcon Coffee
We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny
VINCENT
So if youre quitting the life
whatll you do
JULES
Thats what Ive been sitting here
contemplating First Im gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus Then
basically Im gonna walk the earth
VINCENT
What do you mean walk the earth
JULES
You know like Caine in KUNG FU
Just walk from town to town meet
people get in adventures
VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth
JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be
VINCENT
What if he never does
JULES
If it takes forever Ill wait
forever
VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum
JULES
Ill just be Jules Vincent  no
more no less
VINCENT
No Jules youre gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin zombies they sleep in
garbage bins they eat what I throw
away and dogs piss on em They got
a word for em theyre called bums
And without a job residence or
legal tender thats what youre
gonna be  a fuckin bum
JULES
Look my friend this is just where
me and you differ 
VINCENT
 what happened was peculiar  no
doubt about it  but it wasnt water
into wine
JULES
All shapes and sizes Vince
VINCENT
Stop fuckin talkin like that
JULES
If you find my answers frightening
Vincent you should cease askin
scary questions
VINCENT
I gotta take a shit To be continued
Vincent exits for the restroom
Jules alone takes a mouthful of muffin then Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised
PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool this is a robbery
HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin pricks move and
Ill execute every one of you

Jules looks up not believing what hes seeing Under the

PUMPKIN
Not regularly
JULES
Theres a passage I got memorized
Ezekiel  The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men  Blessed is
he who in the name of charity and
good will shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness For he
is truly his brothers keeper and
the finder of lost children And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you I been sayin that shit for
years  And if you ever heard it it
meant your ass I never really
questioned what it meant I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker fore you popped
a cap in his ass But I saw some
shit this mornin made me think twice
Now Im thinkin it could mean youre
the evil man And Im the righteous
man  And Mr  here hes the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness Or is
could by youre the righteous man
and Im the shepherd and its the
world thats evil and selfish  Id
like that But that shit aint the
truth The truth is youre the weak
And Im the tyranny of evil men But
Im tryin Im tryin real hard to
be a shepherd
Jules lowers his gun lying it on the table
Pumpkin looks at him to the money in his hand then to
Yolanda
She looks back
Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets the two RUN out the
door
Jules who was never risen from his seat the whole time
takes a sip of coffee
JULES
to himself
Its cold
He pushes it aside
Vincent appears next to Jules
VINCENT

JULES

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase
Then to the amazement of the Patrons the Waitresses the
Cooks the Bus Boys and the Manager these two badass dudes
 wearing UC Santa Cruz and Im with Stupid teeshirts
swim trunks thongs and packing  Automatics  walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word
FADE OUT
THE END
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy aint doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just cant seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song

Finally saved some money up
Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didnt have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I cant seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song
But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song
Ive got some big news
The bank finally came through
And Im holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake
Theres a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the fourwheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

Cause its a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
Ive got the perfect place in mind
Its in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear
I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires


And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin trouble
Half your life makin it right
One day Im the exception
Most days Im just like most
Some days Im headed in the right direction
And some days I aint even close

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just dont run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still dont get it right sometimes
I just dont get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah but now I dont stay near as long

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn burn burning man
Just a burning man
Woo

Maybe Ill go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn burn burning man
Just a burning man

Burning man
It was painted red the stripe was white
It was  feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine put on a motor
Built out of love and made for the water
We had her for years til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a  Johnson and electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
Hed say You cant beat the way a old wood boat rides
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in 
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
Hed let me drive her when wed haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where wed dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Id sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down Ford
With  speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And Id keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Youre doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

Im grown up now  daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day theyll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floor boards hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel
And hed say
Turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now youre doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where wed ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

Its just an old plywood boat
With a  Johnson and electric choke

Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to stayin there
And out of the blue I fell for you

Now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where youve always been
I was hiding in doubt til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new all because of you

And now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies yeah
You give me butterflies

Now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Youre taking my hand stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

Little hat down little John Deere

You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me
Shes my ride or die baby

She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

She likes my Tshirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
Shell take a full moon over those city nights
And I aint scared to get all up in them bright lights

Yeah she loves a small town boy like me
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Dont know what I did next all I know I couldnt stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mamas phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she aint gonna have it
Dont matter how you feel it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this aint my mamas broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and theres nobody else to blame

Cant get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenges just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this aint my mamas broken heart

Powder your nose paint your toes
Line your lips and keep em closed
Cross your legs dot your eyes
And never let em see you cry

Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this aint my mamas broken heart
Lights go down wheels go round
Im taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
Im not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot
Slow dance in a parking lot

A half song gone one door open across the lot
A rentacops rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to Shes Every Woman
And I dont care what song comes next
Im falling right here dont want a safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot

And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got even if its just

A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot
Dont you worry bout gettin fixed up
When you wake up youre pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
Thats my headlights thats my truck

Come on baby dont you keep me waitin
I gotta go Ive got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when youre in my arms

Whoa girl every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa this is one that we dont wanna miss no

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin on my side
Tick tock now were knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin outta moonlight

Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear

Whoa girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa oh heaven let your light shine down

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin on my side
Tick tock now were knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now were runnin outta moonlight

Whoa girl every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa this is one that we dont wanna miss no

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin on my side

All I wanna do is hold you tight

Whoa
Yeah were runnin outta moonlight
Whoa
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor need a couch need a bus fare

This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didnt know
This is where the truth dont lie

You find out who your friends are
Somebodys gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get there fast
Never stop to think Whats in it for me
Or Its way too far
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

Everybody wants to slap your back wants to shake your hand
When youre up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way then you slide back down
Look up and see whos around then

This aint where the road comes to an end
This aint where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

You find out who your friends are
Somebodys gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get there fast
Never stop to think Whats in it for me
Or Its way too far
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

When the waters high
When the weathers not so fair
When the well runs dry
Whos gonna be there

You find out who your friends are
Somebodys gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get there fast
Never stop to think Whats in it for me
Or Its way too far
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are yeah
You find out who your friends are

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man Ive been there
Or get yourself in a bind lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor need a couch need a bus fare
Man Ive been there
Man Ive been there
I aint heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city
Well Im sorry if Im overstepping boundaries
I dont mean to be but Ive just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
Ima be the first one calling you baby Baby
If he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
Ima be the first one calling him crazy Crazy
Cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
That the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
No rush but if he ever singles you up

He hasnt even looked your way since you walked in Walked in
But I cant help it that I cant take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along Singing along
And he dont even know a single word

If he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
Ima be the first one calling you baby Baby
If he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
Ima be the first one calling him crazy Crazy
Cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
That the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
No rush but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
Ima be the first to call baby

Sorry if Im overstepping boundaries
I dont mean to be but Ive just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
Ima be the first one calling you baby Baby
If he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
Ima be the first one calling him crazy Crazy
Cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
That the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
No rush but if he ever singles you up
Oh if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
God and country music
Like whiskey and a prayer
Like Johnny Cashs arm round Billy Graham
God and country music
They both never really change
You find em when you need em where you stand

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin
God and country music
God and country music

God and country music
They both show you the truth
Theyve seen the low of the valley
And the highs of the mountains too
Folded hands and guitar strings
Jukebox preachers and angels sing
Call you like they knew ya
Between the hell and hallelujah

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its still livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin
God and country music
God and country music

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its still livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin
God and country music
God and country music
God and country music
God and country music
They say Love is more precious than gold
Cant be bought and it cant be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
Shes my treasure so very rare
She made me a millionaire

When we ride around ride around this old town
In my beatup car with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say That boy is sure livin in luxury
Sweet luxury

Cause love is more precious than gold
It cant be bought no never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire


When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Cause love is more precious than gold
It cant be bought and it cant be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
Youre hit then miss youre fire and ice
Youre water and whiskey burn
We kiss we fight make up all night
Youre the blessing and the curse
But I dont ever wanna break this chain
I dont ever wanna walk away
Cause I aint ever gonna find another lover
Wholl make me feel this way

Over and over and over we say that were through
But I come right back to you

Theres a long stretch of love coming down the line
Im your rock that wont ever roll and baby youll be mine
Ill be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby were in for a long stretch of love

You lift me up you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights

Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose well never change

Theres a long stretch of love coming down the line
Im your rock that wont ever roll and baby youll be mine
Ill be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby were in for a long stretch of love

Long stretch of love long stretch of love long stretch of love
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose well never change

Theres a long stretch of love coming down the line
Im your rock that wont ever roll and baby youll be mine
Ill be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby were in for a long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love

I dont wanna break this chain
I aint gonna walk away in this long stretch of love
I got bored with  beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a  the Game spit  I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to  s  times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number  is capacity Number  is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at  palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot  ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways  wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
Im memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself GW Im positive its him
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history

I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December st  is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitobas melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready dress right dress
Not messy my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You cant contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose  throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite  s  times
For hrs  thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa  as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers evaporated weed vapour Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Meteors fall from the sky The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart controlling my mind
Oh Lord Tell me what to do Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts Ive passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions  Reality
Thats how it has to be
In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose  I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy  you wanna be the best You crazy
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven white hot thermal
External vision every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real we are cogs in a wheel
We work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the para and the hyperbolas
Tiger Woods knows this everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me Ill murder you lay you down vertical
Made your life purposeful germinated the earth with you
My black goggles are covered with Bat Guano
Ill hang from the ceiling and watch you act hostile Ill pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it dont owe me nothing
I dont want nothing from you not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldnt waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability the enemy tried to imprison me
But they wouldve been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm grammar and composition
Dont ignore me ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not
If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide
Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession
St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a  Bar message
Now you may go
You have graduated now you may know
Tell the world exactly what you were shown
Sho nuff sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown  more months
Does it amaze me NO Does it phase me maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate doe
Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show
Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold
Mind Body  Soul inseparable incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with  chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay
I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricanes eyes open
Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence
Dont be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style its like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan
West Coasting in a  with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
Im waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping I had to do something
I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze
Dont look at it like winning or losing in  it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing
Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease
You cant Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk
If you ever leave youll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel  digits in  minutes
Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah
Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas
You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect
Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone til November Ill be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but Im still alive
Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds
resistance is futile they said
I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write its a sin 
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
Theres no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it
Pages upon pages everything Ive created
The bar was below basic I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 
Dr Watson and Crick found an rd strand in the DNA helix
So your not what you think
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
Cheers I spill beer on my bear skin chairs
I shed tears I loved Hip Hop all these years
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

Nobody do it better there aint a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet It must have been who was it then
Rip The Jacker hot but cold blooded
Many utter the name but very few love him
 is the number that enlightens the Brothers
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome what should we call it
I call it my unacknowledged special access project
My skull is a submarine hull
In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall
Necronomicon grimoires open the doors
The vortex that reaches from here to beyond
The power to control thoughts however remotely
Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry
The results from SETI very interesting
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing
My team was credited we turned over the evidence
But not before I could leverage it for promotion to President
Cover me  point sighting device for the eyes
FIRE Transition if you go dry
Close your eyes ritualize spit your rhymes
Without trying you can shift your mind
Canibus altered the sequence nucleotides
Neuropetides only get high off mature Wine
Start timing Atomic Clock keeps time perfectly 
Mrs Guutoff my band teacher always would work me
Polyester pants big fat ass
I loved that woman so much I paid attention in class
My Spanish teacher Mrs Booker had an ass too
Why am I talking about this to you
One day this will be known for now I must wait
I still love them both and I never forget a face
At the time I used my Beta waves more than my Theta waves
Then there was greater way I learned at a later date
The rate of learning began burgeoning and wouldnt let up 
Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed
Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice
When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress
It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me
I know my history but what could that mean specifically
The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep
I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet
A Clairvoyant Technique
Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future
I can see past it 
But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say its more than a dream
Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers
Electromagnetic Scalars
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie
If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai
Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn
Spit a  bars before you could run  yards 
I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch
It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked
You wanna stand there and talk
The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon
It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling
But when Im out with the family I am animal handling
Observe a man who has a third DNA strand
Or a th or a th this is way more advanced
I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly
The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 
I am not innocent but you cannot punish me
Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy
What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self
Few of the same ilk have known what I felt
Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle
Yo I need to stop smoking purple
Requested selected elected but thats only impressive to the experts
Who know how to manipulate my message 
You lazy and you wanna be the best I repeat
Dont talk about consciousness when you are consciousless and weak
If I die and YOU happen to wake up Im still alive
Please explain my complete life story to my children
Photo stills of the cryospill
Solarized film revealed there was a biofield
Fuck a record deal my training is real
Look at the sword I wield you will taste my steel
Phase I sign the MOU pursue more voters
Theres three more phases that I think you should know 
Phase II build the force Phase III sustain Ops
Phase IV transition of Border Patrol Cops
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La SiDo
These are the tones that will activate the ohms
No telling if it will bring out the best or the worst in you
It would be a miracle if I was merciful
Are you food for the moon Or are you in the mood for doom
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
STRYKER BRIGADE Driver sometimes I was GUNNER
Check points required all the concentration I could muster 
Special Weapons And Tactics Professional Assassin
I dont know what he does for a living ask him
I kneel before Congress and beg for money
Submitting specifics about the operation Im running
You gotta love it what was it called The G Summit
Never heard of it no details are public
The relative radiance of the rhyme makes it shine
Increasing the star wattage with longer cycle time
Yeah I bust the rhymes but I customize the lines
And by the looks of things I did it just in time 
I marched from the Halls of Montezuma to Tripoli
Physically this mission objective is killing me
I submit to the will of the creator willingly
The possibilities present a probable infinity
I looked into LLs eyes we both cried
Meteors immediately fell from the skies
Ive apologized but I cant change who I am
I can change future cant budge the past
Them pretty ass lyrics is for bitches with acrylic
Only fake niggas catch feelings over silly shit 
SPORTS locked and loaded zero you in from the pillbox
Williams How many kills you got
The uniforms match so we all look the same from the sky
They only time they notice the difference is when we die
Is dying a wise thing What about trying
What about our family members back home crying
Man made weapons Star Ship Captain etc
George Lucas showed me a full size replica
We circled for a fly over in a black KIOWA
 soldiers including me and a pilot called Noah
He passed over a top secret dossier folder half opened 
I noticed the words MOSES and CONUS
MOSES is a new weapon system secret code
CONUS is the continent of the US I suppose
The jump light lit up Master Chief said Lets Go
All right men this is what we train for
Williams you gotta go first if you say so HALO High Altitude Stay Low
Gale Winds blowing this might be the death of me
The AIRBORNE unit in the back of me jumped out next to me
Gold chords from the organ cut down your swordsman
Tell everybody to shut the fuck up when Im talking 
Not in current version fuel mix rich human hydrogen slush
The rhymes are too Christ Complex like for them
The  Bar race at an unrelenting pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War 
Do you believe in fate Then how do you know
When you finally get there where will you go
This aint no joke you think Im joking
Everything frozen melted destroyed broken
Only the chosen find a way out
Everybody move out Stay off the main route 
Satellites watch me they think they got me
Right hands turn left shoulders around but its not me
Atmospheric Reentry a flying sighting looked like lightening
Striking blind what it struck was frying
Comparative image sharpness between all artists
I dont think you know what youre about to get involved in
Ill give a quadrillion dollars to be a partner
If you are still worshipping money you are Godless
Sulphuric Nitric Acid eats through the Labyrinth
The foundation is cracking we must take action 
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth BIBLE
I take shelter in an old Missile Silo
Hip Hop is blackened pot placed next to a kettle
With my logo in it a rigid rehomogenized metal
Millions of you are unfamiliar with what Im saying
Discuss it with your Chemistry Professor he will praise it
Tri Quad Quintangulate where did the signal originated
Try to find out more information
The internal atheist outside the MATRIX
Sophia Stewart offered me a pill and said take this
She asked me if I was followed I told her I wasnt
I didnt know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
A populace uniformed is a populace of slaves
Washington didnt say it quite that way
But its something like that you get the point Im assuming
Poet Laureate Exclusive New Shit
The message said We should meet somewhere clandestine
Professor keep heading East to the Best Western
Do not loose your bearings keep checking your direction
Start Session point  arc seconds
The budget is huge I have doubts about spending it
Concerning Cyclotronic Resonance patents are pending it
Canibus aka The Spitzberg Beast
Gave his Bicentennial Speech on Emerald Peak
Youll need a first aid kit for the verse I spit
I am cautiously meticulous but artfully brisk
A change is beginning every molecule is spinning
Lyrics imitate the art art imitates lyrics can you hear it
Signals bounce back and forth like a mirror
With flawless error like that forever
Surface the air radar tells me where they are 
Are they far I patiently watch the sweep arm
We can find them but they cant find us
Just below Mach  the rhymes ionizes
Im hooked on Hip Hop I cant live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I dont doubt it
The daughters of man locked in prison camps
With the sons of mothers that are too weak to dance
At least we notice damage what do we expect
The coming super storm is gonna wipe us off the map 
But that is not possible thats sounds completely illogical
You mustve been kicked the fuck out of school
Always remember the Reptilian agenda
No Pulse Rendered in the earthquakes epicentre
I found fluoride in my water supply
At the time I felt a total apathy towards dying
The ungrateful dead reoccurring images playing in my head
I was told to memorize what I was said
With this salt I consecrate this water
May whatever it touch receive Hallowed LIGHT from THEM
With this sacred water I consecrate this Talisman so that
It will make ME POET LAUREATE otherwise Ill be so depressed oh well no
Regrets I been toe to toe with the best I KNOW the LEDGE
I accept all cultures colours creeds and races
Life is Life no taxonomical classification
No corruption no disruption no destruction no budget no nothing
Its never that easy you just gotta trust it
A leader I feel beleaguered to teach the truth
The Youth will refuse to follow if they dont believe you
There is strength in numbers there are numbers in strength
Nothing good comes from hatred Loves the missing link
Even if I am in a minority of one
The truth is still the truth no matter how its spun
My mind is prepared Hip Hop is impaired
If you disagree with me then yours isnt there

I rock rhymes for your pleasure you listen at your leisure
I only record it once you listen to it forever
The fish hook stuck in your jaws the feedback was not positive
Human Hominids fishing for compliments
Started with a nugget the budget snowballed into something
Above ground running not underground covered
Breath easy regulate the pace see if they love it
The Poet Laureate puppet with a message from THE OTHERS
The aura describes the forces
Im too involved to divorce it my internal compass points me northward
My skull is a submarine hull calling whales with whale song
Creating basketball size hailstorms
Water World under water war protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
My war birds are grounded their wings have been burned off
Im not concerned though its only the first lost
Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry
Poet Laureate infinity now you know its me
Yeti riding a Triceratops with Elephant netting
Attending Black Widow weddings dressing in gossamer webbing
Pretending experimenting they call me a heretic
A derelict cherubim seraphim protecting America
Height weight eye colour skeletal structure was designed
I circle my flight instructors in the skies as they fly
 times to show them I have plenty new rhymes
Poet Laureate will prove it to you all in due time
Dont be upset with Canibus yet the kid just want respect
You been a success but what do he get
Politics and Perjury bring out the worst in me
But I dont take it personally even though its hurting me
The key maker turns the key those observing me keep cursing me
They arent worthy of a word from me
I spit the truth Rip the mic Rip the booth Rip you too
Rip the Jacker is proof I Ripped through
It drives me insane when a woman wears lace
The current gene structure is  pair based
Her heart rumbling and thundering like Captain Nicole Malachowski from an
Airbase on a clear day
Ok Im a pervert Its time to fess up
I might be looking for a leg up but I wont touch
Closet sadomasochist sexual pacifist
I like to role play but I only play masculine
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
Im a giant in the industry just over  ft
Even my photo ID dont look like me
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me DREAM
Another fucking acronym just what I need
Killing me with phrases that were designed to put me into dazes
As worthless as my junk mail is
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The Squid Faced God is difficult to describe
Those of weak heart and mind shouldnt even try
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jahlalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
Astoria Oregon Fisherman Poets got lost
Looking for Paradise it only exists in the heart
Cause emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions and Reality
But what is attracting me
The overseer of poetic antiquity
The Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Pythagoras Dionysus Loki and Pan
They have enlightened me thru song to understand
The multiplex meshing multiple messages is too much for me
Truly there is too much to see
Ill mix one for you then one for me
Ill mix some for the street mix til my thumbs bleed
A stationary pulley drawing from a wishing well
The Genie gave me more than three because I listen well
Conflicted and confused but completely compelled
To celebrate my birthday alone in the year 
I hope I am not alone that would be terrible
If I am celebrating then that would be a miracle
In a newly ordered world living in shit
No matter how good or poor your English is
You lazy and you wanna be the best You crazy
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
Ermaine Will I am the name that my precious mother gave me
The world came to know me as Sir William
The man of steel with a Smallville build with the illest
Some of my thoughts align with Einstein himself
I wanna know Gods thoughts too the rest are details
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course but
The secret to creativity is hiding your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them and hold their humanity hostage
Pray for the families that want them home
Pray for the families abroad that have lost their homes
Who have lost their faith who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point who have lost their own
Yo calm the fuck down I shouldnt have to curse at you
Hydrate as much as possible drink a lot of juice
Fucking bummer no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfucking sandbag for cover
Now Im self employed still gotta pay taxes
Cashless bankrupt aint got no assets
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I dont want it thats why Im rarely seen in public
President Poetry the popular obedient Pundit
Thats right you can take this job and shove it
I dictate a scribe that causes the court stenographer to die
Brewing hot tea with honey and lime
How is my driving Run you off the road smiling
RoadRage Start dialing
The snake will grow feet and stampede you to your defeat
You are weak you lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Rock climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign
In record clock time Hot Lava lock rhymes rock slide topside
How does one ever really perfect such a craft
Youre obliged by your curiosity to ask
Cubism and Futurism writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you cant be serious
Test driving my principle findings
By designing a new style of rhyming you can take home and try out
A  Bars per hour sometimes I doubled the writing secret signature timing
Was the hardest part to figure out
Agonizing the pain of the migraine biting my brain
And everything inside it I cant explain but Im trying
I heard this before I cant remember who said it
We hear from  to  thousand cycles per second
Straight out the freak show no preshow
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breath slow
VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules by the Book
You should know this even though it concern the showbiz
Because when in Rome walk as a Roman
Obviously you can see youve made the wrong choice
Fraternize but dont do it in the wrong tone of voice
A bad boy with bad toys made from new alloys
Readapted from a crashed asteroid
My shelter is not far you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble weeds
After the Matrix Agent Smith continued his movement
The same bullshit that humans are major pollutants
Assemble the Gatlin gun spin it see if it spun
My rap room is an  by  underground base
Hyper cube microphone booth in a vacuum of space
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
All these conscious rappers aint saying nothing
Matter fact they have no constituent function
Mix this record different youll hear me call names out
Its played out but there must be alternative routes
The Geneva Protocol Advocates are so sloppy
A human being is not anybodys property
Reading body language in a Zero Gravity environment
Is much easier said than done if your trying it
Attending the Opera with a Pompous Ego Monster
I can barely take my eyes off her big old knockers
Integrated in an existing clothing ensemble
My Saratoga Suit is Military Garment
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr Fritz Albert
If the prototype works theres no telling what I will do
Ill have to get a new Plane a new Pilot and a Crew
Creatively I have never been to this level
First Ill put you in a sideways  then a pretzel
Password please have patience verification
I repeat Whats Your Character String Verification
Infrared spectral observation from the Space Station
Before you take a break Ill need you to list and name them
Dock the Kliper Craft at the preliminary designation
Tracing the Detection of Submicron Radiation
Do not leave the Orbital Boom Sensor System running
I heard something called nothing that the Cosmonauts were coming
The rhymes are in place General George Case
And Peter Pace said we had absolutely no time to waste
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
My father is Jamaican my mother is British
Raised to be civic in the household we spoke Yiddish
ELF  cps Elephant Hearing
Im heading for the clearing Storm Clouds appearing
On the back of an Elephant with advanced intelligence
Like Nikola Tesla shit damn thats a smart Elephant
Cease fire breach riot and loot for  weeks dont you see
Broke niggas never promote peace
Suzanne Malveaux will interview the polygamist Mr Bis
Undisclosed in his home by the cliffs
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost what version is this
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk initializing rhyming and visualizing
Reaching  Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends 
We just got a SASO we call this one the Black Hole
Im glad Im the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit target bled proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead youre really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin looking crazy
Cause thats what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
Im a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop dont need me
Nigga I grew up in DC I love Lil Weezy 
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen go climb a tree get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what youve got
Even if it dont add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But Id still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breaths a gift the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like theyre in Panama
Small town spring break
Every weekend round this place
And theres a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
Theyre coming here from all around

To get a little southbound unwound Tennessee Honey kinda buzz

ZHU Working For It
Zoey Dollaz Blow a Check
Ive been thinking bout you all day baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
Its supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like Im going to have to hold you tight yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope its gonna be a long one
And if were lucky its moving slow
I wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Lets go

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train
About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We cant seem to let go girl

So Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over

Im all alone but youre on my phone
Tellin me you miss me and that youre at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin
All I know is I want you

So Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over
Ooh Im comin over

Yeah we said that were done and I know that its late
But you already know Im on my way

Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire thats burnin
Im comin over
Runnin every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it aint workin
Why put out a fire when its still burnin
Just when I think movin on is gettin closer
Im comin over
Im comin over
I got bored with  beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a  the Game spit  I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to  s  times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number  is capacity Number  is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at  palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot  ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways  wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
Im memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself GW Im positive its him
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history

I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December st  is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitobas melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready dress right dress
Not messy my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You cant contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose  throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite  s  times
For hrs  thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it

Real life can get real funny
Whoaohohohoh
We got more love than we got money

Some sing a little higher
Some will just hang low
A few of us are on fire to get out
And some just want to stay home
But it dont matter
Cause our roots run deep
And aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Whoaohohohoh
Badadadabadadada
Whoaohohohoh

Some of us got problems but everybodys alright
Some of us got big plans some are just planning on gettin by
Some of us got problems but they love us anyway
Through thick and thin hell were still kin at the end of the day

Some sing a little higher
Some will just hang low
A few of us are on fire to get out
And some just want to stay home
But it dont matter
Cause our roots run deep
And aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Whoaohohohoh
Real life can get real funny
Whoaohohohoh
We got more love than we got money
Aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Whoaohohohoh
oh our roots run deep
Whoaohohohoh
Aint nothin aint nothin gonna shake
Aint nothing gonna shake our Family Tree
Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in with feathers on his head
Mamas in her room learnin how to sew
Daddys drinkin beer listenin to the radio

Hank Williams sings KawLiga and Dear John
And time marches on time marches on

Sisters using rouge and clear complection soap
Brothers wearin beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed barely makes a sound
Daddys got a girlfriend in another town

Bob Dylan sings Like a Rolling Stone
And time marches on time marches on

The South moves north the North moves south
A star is born a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes everything changes

Sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brothers on a diet for high cholesterol
Mamas out of touch with reality
Daddys in the ground beneath the maple tree

As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on time marches on
Time marches on time marches on
Time marches on time marches on

I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
May we all get to grow up in a red white and blue little town
Get a wontstart handmedown Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you cant wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing aint cool til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
Shes smilin with her hair blowing out the window
Where you bout to go
Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all

May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Aint gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
Well all be watching the TV the day that it comes

May we all know that nothing aint cool til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the Pac
Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
Shes smilin with her hair blowing out the window
Where you bout to go
Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all

May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
May we all walk away wiser when we crashed one
May we all keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
May we all
I dont know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I dont mean to bother you but
I couldnt just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And youre not looking for anything right now
So I dont wanna come on strong
Dont get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
Its just a conversation
No girl Im not wasted
You dont know me
I dont know you but I want to

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I dont wanna wreck your Friday
I aint gonna waste my lines
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know youre try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And Im sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause shes supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
Its the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You couldve rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Couldve walked away
But youre still here
And Im still here
Come on lets see where it goes

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I dont have to meet your mother
We dont have to cross that line
I dont wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I dont wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I dont wanna steal your freedom
I dont wanna change your mind
I dont have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I dont wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No I aint gotta call you baby
And I aint gotta call you mine
I dont have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
Ive cussed on a Sunday
Ive cheated and Ive lied
Ive fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin every single verse
Yeah I guess thats my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burnin
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin every single verse
Yeah I guess thats my church

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin every single verse
Yeah I guess thats my church

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin every single verse
Yeah I guess thats my church
Yeah I guess thats my church
Yeah I guess thats my church
Je sais faire des thunes mme si je nai pas fait dtudes comme a dit maman

Si tu pars de rien tu ten sors tes le matre
Les faibles y restent et les plus forts se lvent
Trop de principes je peux pas les salir
Cest ce qui ma souvent rendu instable
Jai des ides pour qules plantes salignent
Sur linstant jai toujours suivi linstinct
Je sais faire des thunes mme si je nai pas fait dtudes comme a dit maman

On peut sadapter nimporte o dans le monde nos codes sont universels

La fille habite  Mabillon

Mauvaise pour ma biatch coute moi bien
Ce que jressens dans le ventre cest le couteau papillon
Pour de la chienna jvais pas chla mes nejeu
Je cuisine ce que tu trouveras pas chez la mnagre
Dans le tour bus le studio est amnag
Premier saut de la falaise javais jamais nag
Javais jamais nag non mais mais jai fais le saut de lange
En criant seulement chaud devant
Tous ces gens sont des lches
Et le sursaut de lge prend des morceaux de lme
Faut que je sorte de l faut que je sorte de l
Jai rempli le sceau de lave avant le saut de lange
Japerois laudel
Jsuis pas dans le crime mais beaucoup des miens sont dedans

Mon ngro jfume que la moula
Pour les ientscli ya le molly

A lpoque a rackettait comme dans GTO

Le jeune bandit a bien grandi vite dtre comme les autres
Ces fake niggies qui bavent sur tes ctes pour des loves

Qui courent sur le fil et qui refont des nuds
Je donne tout pour la famille
Jai compris que personne pas mme lavocat ne me dfendait mieux
Dans cet avenir morose je dois tenir mon rle de tmoin vocal tout en rvant dmeutes
Des gens russ dans la rue des teubs dans la fac
Nouvelles baskets mais je saute les deux pieds dans la flaque

Jrappe pas peace jsuis pass par tes parties
La pratique se fait avec les ratespi
Jarrive sauvage tah les zonards

Tu leur donnes raison seulement quand tu te rsignes
Ose me dire que cest la hess jtenvoie lharissa

Ouais mais cest la merde quand a sort un test salivaire
Ils pensaient que ma carrire ne passerait pas lhiver
Maintenant tu sais quaprs le feu les flammes se ravivrent
On cause des dommages on saccapare le business
Les rappeurs sont au chmage on fait pas dans lhumanitaire
Jsuis tourment jai besoin de me confesser
Cest un coup mont je ne peux pas le contester
Trop mouvement et les fans sont presss
Le rap souffrait jai provoqu son dcs

Suite de malade
Canap en cuir en dessous dses cuisses de mama
Odeur de weed de salade

Les corps se rapprochent on est tous en sueur

Jaime les bons rapports dans la distance
Quand tavales jveux entendre Oui mon matre ou taistoi
Fais a gentiment tu seras une petite poulette qui dcoiffe
Dscolaris rebeu renoi babtou romanichel
Dans les halls la misre
On manigance pour les loves  Bill Gates
Pour les modalits fuck la moralit
Chema dans le bolide mordilletoi les lvres
Audi noire et beige sors nous ton regard exotique
Tu veux nous ressembler  Bandes de nazes
Si ya des femmes mres jveux prendre de lage
Si tes quune sale pute je peux prendre ton tahma

Les bitches veulent des beteu qui giclent de lalcool
Jvite de lapproche si elle sniffe de la colle
Les dalleuses veulent mes dollars
Les filles cest pas dbol si jprends des risques de bad boy
Cest pas pour qutu chilles au Carlton

XXX orgueilleux un saboteur va cracher lfeu
Ds lentre jcompte vous saouler le S en tte daffiche
Ni terroriste ni hagra man ya aucun S sur ma fiche
Jme place parmi les meilleurs dans la catgorie
Mon ciel est bleu ton ciel est gris jrappe avec une touche dironie
Le quartier ma pas appris comment fallait se comporter
Jfuck les leurs et jbaise les bleus jai beaucoup dtraces sur les poignets
Mais jai dla poigne quand jdcide de magripper au mic
Mes fenzis ont dla frappe si ce soir tu veux dcoller
Verre de ros jreste coll  mon bloc
Jregarde de lautre ct du priph elle est barbare mon poque

Jfais partie dces gens trop sincres pour ce monde de vicieux
Donc jai pas prvu dplan B mais tu mas jamais vu trembler
Pourtant une vie peut schanger contre  E
Pendant que jlonge le vide viens pas mparler du danger
Vos dbats souffrent dune atroce strilit
Pour te duper cest les filles biens
Qules salopes ne cessent dimiter
Jsuis quun homme jaime les femmes  forte fertilit
Mais jprfre mon quipe que seule la mort devrait diviser
Et jprtends pas rsoudre les problmes du monde
Jveux juste tre honnte avec mes collgues
Ne jamais dconner pour le gros derche dune blonde
Jai une dent contre ce pays que les commerces surplombent

Ceux qui menvient deviennent ceux qui men veulent
Ceux qui men veulent deviennent ceux qui menvient
Plus je ten donne plus ten veux fils de pute
Jprends nimporte qui en feat
Ils se demandent tous si jai connu la misre
 lpoque de lcole personne nen tait la rise
Jtais endessous de la grande chelle parisienne
Des frres endetts en t se faisaient verbaliser
Il est plus facile de porter des pierres
Que le fardeau dun pch sur son dos
Le libre arbitre peut tapporter le pire
Le roi nest jamais en paix mme sur son trne

La zone est pleine denvieux jdois cacher mon bonheur
Le fric cest comme une femme  jen veux pas si jdois lcher mon honneur
Mes  pills de sangs capter  ou  dmes basans en balle
Encore hier soir un ngro sest fait canner en bas
Recherch a fsait  mois les anciens apprcient mvoient
Les politiques du bloc ressemblent aux cassettes chinois
Harlem Est tu pouvais rarement mcroiser sans le Glock
En cellule nos gardav ressemblent  des soires entre potes
Cest dutch master blunts caf cigarettes
Ma clique est l pour me baffer si jarrte
Donc je nplanifie pas dle faire
Un freestyle de nvrose et fils tas le flaire
Si tes conscient quon est deuspi dans ma clique
Les ngros du bloc me voit et me demandent de revenir dans la street
Cest comme dans le Far West  fusillades  visages dcouverts
Aucun bulletproof vest cest moi qules poulettes trouvent sexy
Nique ouais nique un exil au frais
Les keufs nous espionnent bien cachs dans leurs hlicoptres
Pendant qules bourges festoient je sais qumon hood reste froid
Ceux qui ny croyaient plus reoivent une touche despoir

Fascin par les voyous je voulais leur ressembler
Mais leurs curs taient secs et je le ressentais
Jessaye de rester un gosse
Ya que quand tes un gosse que tes heureux sans bl
Je me sens trs faible mauvais rejeton
Je fais un rejet quand les gens sans cur viennent se greffer
Ma mre elle pensait pas que jirais zoner
Que jlargirais mon rseau prenant des risques irraisonns
Des risques jen ai pris gars a partait en tape dbile
Jme suis retrouv  la brigade dpartementale des mineurs
Ctait lge fallait qua passe
Aprs la haine vient la paix comme ElHajj Malik ElShabazz
On ma dit  Matrise ta colre estce que jtais triste  tort 
Javais la directrice  dos estce que ctait quune crise dado 
Un parcours vrill un samedi soir en gardav

Jai appris qula vie fait pas dcadeau
Jefface mes traces avant le crash sur lasphalte
Nourri de merde mais je suis pas scato
Noye sous la paperasse jvois la daronne devenir paro
Les frres disparaissent et sans tour de passepasse
Mon quipe tpate ya pas qules noich qui vont faire un tabac
Seine zoo Saga on tabasse
Bien plus hard que Tabatha Cash
Tes comme cette gov sur Paname ngro tas pas ta place
Berc par le bruit des sirnes
La symphonie des balles rsonne dans ta ville
Les tympans percs comme la citerne
Assists par nos cits Vitry cest trop deuspi
Confrontant nos ides
On casse des ttes pour smontrer quon est ouverts desprit
Ouais imagine ma tte en poster dans la chambre de cflic

Yo de toute faon on va tous caner ouais ouais lami
Et quand on va cramer on dira tous Ouais cest lDiable qui nous la mise
Vision dcale le vice sinvite sans rien dclarer
Tu trouveras des camramans filmant des cams en camise
Jessaye de sauter le pas la vie me tire par les genoux
En vrai jai plus tendance  tre attir par mes jnouns
La femme et les ruses lhomme et les mots
Pour vous ils sont beaux mais ils sont tous faux de la nuque  lanus
Nique jai quelques vrais le reste qui sont ils 
Passent le salam le regard froid et puis se killent
Bref jvais l ou la vie mmne bref jpleure avec des fous rires
Jmne une vie de merde jraconte mes emmerdes avec le sourire
Jrefuse linvitation car lectrique est la chaise
La vie la mort jai lcul entre deux Pre Lachaise
Seulement nos actes diront si nous sommes valids
Jsuis mal parti un peu comme Johnny jmy fais  lide

Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pickup truck does in the mud
But aint nobody slowing us down right now
She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going quite like you do
When you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about
We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 
Tore up a fence jumped in a ditch felt so good
We didnt want it to end so we went
Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancing
Didnt take long just a couple of songs
You know its last call when the law comes walking in
So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 
Tore up a fence jumped in a ditch felt so good
We didnt want it to end so we went
Rocking to the radio fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows
We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 
Tore up a fence jumped in a ditch felt so good
We didnt want it to end
Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud
But aint nobody slowing us down right now
Baby here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

Because you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought youd win
Its so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldnt go back there again

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh the damage I could do
Its always your favorite sins
That do you in

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

Never enough
You and tequila
You and tequila make me crazy
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her round the playground
Across the monkey bars to the merrygoround
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Now were grown up and shes my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Aint much changed I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together she still gets to me
Cant believe its been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
I cant count the times
I almost said whats on my mind
But I didnt
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things Id say
But I couldnt
I just couldnt

Baby I know that youve been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing

In case you didnt know
Baby Im crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
Im thinking

One of the things that Ive been feeling
Mmm its time you hear em

In case you didnt know
Baby Im crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know

Youve got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah youre my everything

In case you didnt know
Im crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I dont tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didnt know
In case you didnt know
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside I couldnt get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isnt all that it seems I did you wrong
Ill stay here with you until this dream is gone

Ive been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take whats lost and broke
And make it right
Ive been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But its the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people dont ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
Id be the one you thought youd find
Love isnt all that it seems I did you wrong
Ill stay here with you until this dream is gone

Ive been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take whats lost and broke
And make it right
Ive been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But its the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh and I dont want to wake up
In this burning house

Ive been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take whats lost and broke
And make it right
Ive been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But its the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldnt be
Really I shouldnt be

One more call
Its one more Whatcha doing right now
Its one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our tshirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself Im not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then youre a goner
And Im here wishing you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool yeah I try to be
Like it dont bother me
The last time was the last time
Until Im all alone and picking up the phone

Its one more call
Its one more Whatcha doing right now
Its one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
Its one more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our tshirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself Im not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then youre a goner
And Im here wishing you could stay a little longer

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our tshirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself Im not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then youre a goner
And Im here wishing you could stay a little longer

Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer
Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldnt know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in nineteen sixtyfour
My grandfather was a drinker back in the day hed put em down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskeys known to change a man

But thats not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but Ill smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldnt go in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all Ill ever be

Now its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in LA
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset he put me up at the Marquee
He said You wanna sell a million records boy You better listen to me

He said Change your style whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life youd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around

I said no thats not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old tshirts and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
Cause a country boy is all Ill ever be

Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
Youll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourtyfive
Ive got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck and my idea of heavens chasin white tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive

Now two flags fly above my land and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud the red the white the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
Dont tread on me is what it says and Ill take that to my grave

Because this is me
Im proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again cause Ive never needed government to hold my hand
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again cause my familys always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all Ill ever be

I love my country I love my guns I love my family I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes cause this is America and a country boy is good enough for me son
You know theres a light that glows by the front door
Dont forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It wont be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Dont steal dont cheat and dont lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams youre dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Dont expect a free ride from no one
Dont hold a grudge or a chip and heres why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin with someone
And sleepin with someone you love
I love you aint no pickup line so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Dont steal dont cheat and dont lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams youre dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind Yeah

When its hot eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Dont take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where youre goin dont forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind
Beer dont keep
Loves not cheap
And trucks dont wreck themselves
Mama aint a shrink
Daddy aint a bank
And God aint a wishin well
Money aint rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it

Girls like to laugh
Tears dont last
And scareds what prayings for
If its close swing the bat
Everybodys gotta past
And loves worth living for
When you dance hold her close
Til it breaks go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No you dont get to do some things again

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it

When you cant take it slow
Cause time sure wont
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her til your glass runs out of sand

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it
Some of it
She took off down the road
Towards Austin and I lost it
I heard she wound up in Fort Worth
No I aint been the same since
My hearts as hard as that old Caliche dirt

Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I aint even gonna lie
Some days I dont wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And dont even get me started on some nights

I guess I could always call her but why bother
Hell she wont pick up that phone
Got no pride left to swallow so tomorrow
Ill try again to just move on

Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I aint even gonna lie
Some days I dont wanna get up
I just wanna give up
Dont even get me started on some nights


Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I aint even gonna lie
Some days I dont wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And dont even get me started
Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I aint even gonna lie
Some days I dont wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And dont even get me started on some nights
Mmm some nights

She took off down the road
Towards Austin and I lost it
Mistakes were gonna make em
Chances gonna take em
Walls try and break em down
Time were gonna steal it
Love like a drug gonna deal it
That high I wanna feel it now
Ive been talking to the stars
Been reaching through the dark
Been holding out my heart

Do you ever lay awake at night staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if its gonna drop on you like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away get scared youll lose your faith
Like its all gonna stop on you walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too

Everybodys got beautiful we all got scars
Why hide behind a filter youre a perfect work of art
What on earth are we here for
What happens next
For all the things I think I know
Theres so much I dont get

Do you ever lay awake at night staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if its gonna drop on you like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away get scared youll lose your faith
Like its all gonna stop on you walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too

Ive been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons need something to believe in
Ive been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons need something to believe in
Something to believe in

Do you ever lay awake at night staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if its gonna drop on you like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away get scared youll lose your faith
Like its all gonna stop on you walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too
Yeah I do too
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that Ive had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin rain

And I know that I cant ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
Youre a saint youre a goddess the cutest the hottest a masterpiece
Its too good to be true nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

And I know that I cant ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah yeah
Mmm

I dont need no vacation no fancy destination
Baby youre my great escape
We could stay at home listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die I could die a happy man
Mmm
The way your fingers fit in mine
Its five plus five not rocket science
This day in time thats hard to find its true
The road were on aint a traffic jam
Its a Sunday drive on a piece of land
Its paradise as long as Im with you

Its like one two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Aint no need to complicate it we both know thats overrated
Weve been there its safe to say it aint our style
Its just that simple SIMPLE
Simple as can be

We used to live on Instagram
Worry bout who all gives a damn
Bout where weve been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

Its like one two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Aint no need to complicate it we both know thats overrated
Weve been there its safe to say it aint our style

Thank you girl from Broken Bow who shot an arrow through my heart
Thank you mama for the roll and
Thank you daddy for the rock
Most of all most of all
Thanks to the bulls that bucked me off woo

Aw hell what if

Then it gave a little broken heart somewhere some hope
And Id jump up on the stage and the chorus would go
Da da da da da da da da da

Gonna drive like hell through your neighbourhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank
Sit on the hood and drink
Im about to get my pissed off on
Im gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didnt come here to start a fight but Im up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Wish I knew how long its been going on
How long youve been getting some on the side
Nah he cant amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well he wont be getting any sleep tonight
Im gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didnt come here to start a fight but Im up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy

Endless love and happiness

Youve gone and broke the wrong heart baby
And drove me redneck crazy
You drove me redneck crazy oh yeah
Hadnt had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I wouldve just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldnt be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Yeah you hit me Category 
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it aint but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby without warning
Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin stars quit shinin
Rain was drivin thunder n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and Im fine Im fine

But when I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cuttin up the floor in a sorority Tshirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible baby Id never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila When I when I when I
When I taste tequila When I when I when I

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby your memory it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cuttin up the floor in a sorority Tshirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible baby Id never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya Need ya
When I taste tequila When I when I when I
When I taste tequila oh When I when I when I

I aint even drunk I aint even drunk and Im thinkin
How I need your love how I need your love yeah it sinks in

When I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Sorority Tshirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible baby Id never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya Need ya
When I taste tequila When I when I when I
When I taste tequila oh When I when I when I
When I taste tequila oh When I when I when I
When I taste tequila When I when I when I
Ooh
Hey momma how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress
Black mascara off a pillowcase
Cure a onetoomany headache
Momma can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next
And hey how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart

Can you ask Daddy if hes got time
To come and look at my front door
It got slammed last night
And now it dont close right
And just promise that you wont tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Momma please dont say
Im gonna laugh about this someday
You didnt see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart
Oh a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin so hard
Can you go blind from crying in the dark
Was it ever really real
If he dont feel like I feel

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart
A broken heart
We didnt care if people stared
Wed make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebodyd tell us to get a room
Its hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that were okay
But I dont want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long bet you forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldnt get enough
Remind me remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldnt stop
And I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be
Wed turn out the lights and we didnt just sleep
Remind me baby remind me
Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Dont just assume I know
Oh baby remind me
Remind me
Do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldnt control ourselves
Remind me yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me oh baby remind me
Yeah youd wake up in my old tshirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me
Baby remind me yeah oh
Yeah youd wake up in my old tshirt
Baby remind me
You may think that Im talking foolish
Youve heard that Im wild and Im free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
Youre not just time that Im killing
Im no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  oh baby

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Ill be happy to tell you again
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey I dont care I aint in love with your hair
And if it all fell out well Id love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well its easy to see its happening to me
Ive already forgotten every woman but you  oh darling

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Well just listen to how this song ends
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Like a rainy Sunday mornin
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
Youre my inspiration girl
You take me places put the words right into these songs

Stealin kisses under cover babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
Youre my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half my savin grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers angel
Yeah Im down for life you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you cant tell

You make it easy lovin up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
Youre my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half my savin grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

Stealin kisses under cover babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
Youre my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half my savin grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy
Verse 
Rip the calendar page out for May
The days gettin longer
Into the sun outta the shade
Pretty girls by the water
The DJ dont spin slow songs
Cause everybody wants to dance
Everything you love about the summer
Just brings your memory back
To when it was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Verse 
Every sunset smile and midnight kiss
Yeah I still remember
Im still burnin backroads in my head
Every June to September
Oh yeah it doesnt get any better
When it was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Bridge
It was
All you
All me
All night
All summer long
It was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Outtro
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer

Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said she said
Aint it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something yall dont know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
Im tired of talking man yall aint listening
Them old dirt roads is what yall missing

Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if its broke round here we fix it
I can take yall where ya need to go
Down to my hood back in them woods

We do it different round here thats right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
Well raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires
Im chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like Im George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An ice cold beer sitting in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Its got me reminiscing on them good times
Im turning off of real life driving thats right
Im hitting easy street on mud tires
Thats right
You said I love you to me
And I dont know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldnt believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything Ive been feelin about you
Its time to break the chains that held me back from you

So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No I literally dont mind
Just please dont misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No baby be mine now
Baby be mine now
Maybe its time we put our hearts in a parallel line

Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But Ive been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now its time to close the space between the two of us

So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No I literally dont mind
Just please dont misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No baby be mine now
Baby be mine now
Maybe its time we put our hearts in a parallel line

Oh baby its time
Oh its time

Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No I literally dont mind
Just please dont misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No baby be mine now
Baby be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No I literally dont mind
Just please dont misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No baby be mine now
Baby be mine now

Maybe its time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
This mornin I got up at 
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree Ive seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
Its a beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my tshirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like Id lost my mind
I said Baby I love you cant live without you I know I dont say it enough

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Like you never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missing
Some days youre living
Ita beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you start singin
And you dont need a reason
Sometimes the worlds just right
Your clear eyes aint even blinkin
Got a heart full of grateful
For all youve been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Livin like youll never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missin
Some days youre living
Some days youre living
A woman is mystery
A man just cant understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows theres so many ways
A man can go wrong

Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doing something right

Anywhere you want to go
Baby show me the way
Im open to suggestions
Mmm whatever you say
Tonights about giving you
What you want whatever it takes
Girl I hope Im on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doing something right

Ah Baby
Mmm

I dont know what I did
To earn a love like this but baby I
Must be doin something right
Must be doin something right
People talkin bout what is and what aint country
What gives em the right to wear a pair of beatup boots
Is it the size of your tires and your fires or your wild ass buddies
Well give me a minute let me hit you with some hometown truth

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin on the rain
Were all a little different but were all the same
Everybody doin their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight and that was us
It might not have been you but I cant judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood
Did it come from your daddy and mama
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little greeneyed girl from Jackson
Tell me what got ya I just gotta know

Me I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight and that was us
It might not have been you but I cant judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down
You know you gotta let it out

I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight and that was us
It might not have been you but I aint judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country
There were Chevys and levees whiskey and rye
Friends no end to the summertime
Gas was cheap and the radio was free
So were we on those back streets
Chasing good times and pretty girls
Cause when youre young your whole world is

Bloodshot eyes watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
Its a full heart falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
Drinking up every moment til its gone
Just rockin all night long

Theres a know when you know kinda feeling you get
When that light strikes on a first kiss
When she smiled I had no doubts
So I put a ring on the finger I was wrapped around
We were midnight holding on
Giving in to what the heart wants

It was a bloodshot eyes watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
Its a full heart falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
And drinking up every moment til its gone
Just rockin all night long

Now its am and Im in a rocking chair
And a row of pink everywhere
Shes got her mamas smile and lungs like her dad
Shes the best reason I ever had

For a bloodshot eyes watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
Its a full heart falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
And drinking up every moment til its gone
Yeah were gonna be here til the break of dawn
Just rockin all night long
Just rockin all night long
Just rockin all night
Rockin all night long

Amarillo by morning up from San Antone
Everything that Ive got is just what Ive got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
Ill be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning Amarillo Ill be there

They took my saddle in Houston broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well Ill be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge aint blind
Amarillo by morning Amarillos on my mind

Amarillo by morning up from San Antone
Everything that Ive got is just what Ive got on
I aint got a dime but what I got is mine
I aint rich but Lord Im free
Amarillo by morning Amarillos where Ill be
Amarillo by morning Amarillos where Ill be
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasnt ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didnt go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasnt ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didnt go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love
A lot about living and a little about love
Yeahee
Thats right
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldnt get my money back so Im in seat A
Im getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now Ive got empty mini bottles fillin both our trays
Im getting drunk on a plane

Buyin drinks for everybody
But the pilot its a party
Got this  rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin sexy
Leanin pourin Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
Its Mardi Gras up in the clouds
Im up so high I may never come down
Ill try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why Im getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
Wed take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey Im getting drunk on a plane

Buyin drinks for everybody
But the pilot its a party
Got this 
Rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin sexy
Leanin pourin Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
Its Mardi Gras up in the clouds
Im up so high I may never come down
Ill try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why Im getting drunk on a plane

On my way home Ill bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land Ill call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey Im drunk on a plane

Buyin drinks for everybody
But the pilot its a party
Got this 
Rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin sexy
Leanin pourin Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
Its Mardi Gras up in the clouds
Im up so high I may never come down
Ill try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why Im getting drunk on a plane

Im getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
Im drunk on a plane
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Dont go looking for the reasons
Dont go asking Jesus why
Were not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I cant find no shade
Just two more rows and Im good to go
Yeah Im shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And Ill be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But Im takin you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But theyre gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But were gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day
Im gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when youre ready to quit
Baby we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home dont worry babe
Im gonna kick them off on the porch

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But Im taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But theyre gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But were gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

A little dirty dancing blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Got a little dirt on my boots
But Im taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But theyre gonna shine with youre up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But were gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Since you turned the tables on me
Ive been steady and learnin lonely
Keepin this turntable spinnin
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin my survival
In a threefoot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
Ive been havin a record year

I bet you thought before you left
Id just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin slow in a livin hell
But loves got a funny way of keepin score
And your leavin lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon one scotch one beer
Im havin a record year

Quarter notes and Hanks half time
Are poundin on this heart of mine
Song to song I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your goodandgone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
Im either gonna get over you
Or Im gonna blow out my ears
Yeah youre out there now
Doin God knows how and Im stuck here
Havin a record year

Your leavin left me goin crazy
Im countin on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go round and round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hanks half time
Are poundin on this heart of mine
Song to song I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your goodandgone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
Im either gonna get over you
Or Im gonna blow out my ears
Yeah youre out there now
Doin God knows how and Im stuck here
Havin a record year
Yeah Im havin a record year
If you aint got two kids by 
Youre probably gonna die alone
At least thats what tradition told you
And it dont matter if you dont believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row like youre sposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer different park

Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddys hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round

We think the first times good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we wont end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Aint what you want its what you know
Just happy in the shoes youre wearin
Same checks were always cashin
To buy a little more distraction

Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddys hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round
Mary Mary quite contrary
Were so bored until were buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just dont give a damn no more
She was sittin all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin by a Georgia plate
I was lookin for her boyfriend
Thinkin no way she aint got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin in love
Tryin to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Id gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin like a fool AM FM XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man you should have seen her light up

She was like oh my God this is my song
Weve been listenin to the radio all night long
I cant believe that it came back on but here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

And she said play it again play it again play it again
The next Friday night we were sittin out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Yeah play it again play it again play it again
Somebody play it again play it again play it again
I see the tears that you cry but I aint gonna drink them
See  before me in your eyes but I just keep on blinking
I know what youre thinking

And maybe if you play if you play a sad song sad song
Im gonna fly your flag Im gonna drop your jag no
Baby you could play it play it all night long night long
But I aint gonna take you back no I aint gonna take you back

I cant hear the violins youre playing
Theres no symphony inside my head
I got my own marching band
Guess I lost my give a damn cause
I cant hear the violins youre playing

Ay you thought you had me by the strings
But I already cut them
Before you sing that song you sing
Let me interrupt it

You think if you play if you play a sad song sad song
You could rub my gypsy lamp and your wish is my command no
Baby you could play it play it all night long night long
But you dont stand a chance its the same old song and dance

Well I cant hear the violins youre playing
Theres no symphony inside my head
I got my own marching band
Guess I lost my give a damn cause
I cant hear the violins youre playing ay

Maybe if you play if you play a sad song sad song
Maybe if you play if you play a sad song sad song ha

I cant hear the violins youre playing
Theres no symphony inside my head
I got my own marching band
Guess I lost my give a damn cause
I cant hear the violins youre playing ay
Square bales flatbeds
Clothesline sunsets
Sky blue barn red
Wind chimes front porch
Good dogs wood floors
Work boots open doors
And miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
Thats who I am and Ill always be

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
Thats where you can find me
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country

Just look at em stars
Must be a billion of em
They just doing they thing
Right where God put em

If this aint heaven its halfway there
You can feel it in the air

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
Thats where you can find me Find me
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country I was brought up in it
Caught up in the country Oh and good Lord willin
Yes I am my way Ill stay
Caught up in it caught up in it
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
Thats where you can find me I was brought up in it

With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Miles and miles of John Deere green
Caught up in the country
Freedom far as I can see
Caught up in the country
A road to run and room to breathe
Thats who I am and Ill always be

Caught up in the country
Caught up in the country
Caught up in the country
in this life
Caught up in the country
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All brokenhearted
I couldnt find a day I didnt feel alone
I never meant to cry started losin hope
But somehow baby
You broke through and saved me

Youre an angel tell me youre never leavin
Cause youre the first thing I know I can believe in

Youre holy holy
Holy holy
Im high on lovin you
High on lovin you
Youre holy holy
Holy holy

Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man cant turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses drippin in diamonds
Sippin on champagne
She was all uptown wearing that white gown
Takin his last name

She could hear those church bells ringin ringin
And up in the loft that whole choir singin singin
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah its all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin ringin
Yeah theyre ringin

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin way too drunk
Saturday night after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin in his eyes

It was all bruises covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringin ringin
And up in the loft that whole choir singin singin
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah its all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin ringin
Yeah theyre ringin

Jenny slipped somethin in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringin ringin
Standin there in a black dress singin singin
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah its all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin ringin
Yeah theyre ringin

Ive been a walking heartache
Ive made a mess of me
The person that Ive been lately
Arent who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you

Theres more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
Youll always be loves great martyr
And Ill be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you

On my own Im only
Half of what I could be
I cant do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say its true
God gave me you gave me you
He gave me you
Id be jealous too if she was with you
Id be out of my mind watching her move
If I was just a guy with across the room view
Id be jealous too if she was with you with you

She laughs like she just broke into a hotel pool
She loves deserts and the sunsets out in Malibu
If you felt the way it feels the way she looks at you
Id be jealous too Id be jealous too

Shes a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they aint ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Cant blame em if they want her like I do
Id be jealous too if she was with you
Id be out my mind watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
Id be jealous too if she was with you

She comes on stronger than a bourbon street hand grenade
Its like you know her fore you even really know her name
If you could see her in the morning sleeping next to you
Just like I get to Id be jealous too

Shes a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they aint ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Cant blame em if they want her like I do
Id be jealous Id be jealous
Id be jealous too
Id be jealous Id be jealous
Id be jealous too

Shes a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they aint ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Cant blame em if they want her like I do
Id be jealous too if she was with you
Id be out my mind watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
Id be jealous too if she was with you with you
 oclock on Friday night Im still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he aint worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now theres only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight Ill let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
Ill let him down easy
Cause tonight its all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Im feeling that buzz
Im ready to rock
Aint no way Im gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
Im coming in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh oh oh oh

Hey Bartender
What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise in the lights
Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Aint never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
Ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
Youre still lying there when it comes back up

Girl what do you say
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
Ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down

Kick your shoes off

Let your hair down hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off kick em off

If youre going out with someone new
Im going out with someone too
I wont feel sorry for me Im getting drunk
But Id much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three am
Youre fighting with your mom again
And Id go Id go Id go somewhere with you

I wont sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me climb in their bed
When Id much rather sleep somewhere with you
Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car out by the pier
You laid me down whispered in my ear
I hate my life hold on to me
Ah if you ever decide to leave
Then Ill go Ill go Ill go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But its just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
Im somewhere with you somewhere with you
If you see me out on the town
And it looks like Im burning it down
You wont ask and I wont say
But in my heart Im always somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three am
Youre fighting with your mom again
And Id go Id go Id go somewhere with you

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But its just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
Im somewhere with you somewhere with you

Somewhere with you

Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Well the plane touched down just about three oclock
And the citys still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life Im living in
But the plane brought me farther Im surrounded by water
And Im not going back again

I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah Im leaving GA
And if it werent for tequila and pretty seoritas
Id have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah Im leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They cant believe that I just couldnt leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender shes from the islands
Her bodys been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I dont know if its her or the rum

I got my toes in the water ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes and all the muchachas they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And Ill grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The seoritas dont careo when theres no dinero
Yeah I got no money to stay

Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

Im just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today life is good today
Yeah I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing Id ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldnt say anything
So I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah shes moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
Shes got me wondering yeah Im just wondering
Where she at where she at where she at tonight
Where she at where she at where she at tonight

So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah shes moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
Shes got me wondering yeah Im just wondering
Where she at where she at where she at tonight
Where she at where she at where she at tonight
Shes got me mesmerized shes all Im thinking about
All I think about think about think about

So Im right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
Id want you to know

You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah youre moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if youre listening listening listening
Where you at where you at where you at tonight
Where you at where you at where you at tonight
Girl Im hanging around this little town
Where you at where you at where you at tonight
Where you at where you at where you at tonight
Girl Im glad you called first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldnt hear your drawl
And that dont sound like you
No that dont sound like you
I know its been a while I dont mean to pry
But when I asked you if youre happy I didnt hear a smile
And that dont sound like you
Nah that aint the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do
Because you dont sound like you any more

Your pretty brown hair you always loved it
Guess he didnt like it so you just cut it
And that dont sound like you
Nah that aint the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do
Cause baby you dont sound like you any more
Oh anymore

That town that job that guy
You can leave them behind girl you know youre better than that
If you want to come back you can come back
Baby come back to

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do
Because you dont sound like you any more

Girl Im glad you called first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldnt hear your drawl
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybodys guess
And I was thinking that I probably didnt stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves walked up and I said
Hey I know I dont know you but Id kinda like a shot
She said I saw you coming over I already thought it over
And okay so now what

And I said well I got a car she said theres something
At least its a start I said its better than nothing
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there aint no way of knowing
I guess I hadnt thought it through that far
But I got a car

So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night when outta nowhere
She said Id give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said I could use a change but I dont even know where to begin

And I said well I got a car she said theres something
At least its a start I said its better than nothing
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there aint no way of knowing
I really hadnt thought it through that far
I cant promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

We got lost in the miles lost track of the days
Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said you know whats on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning rain pouring down
She said I think its time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said what are we gonna do now
And I said well I got a car she said theres something
You think itll start I said its already running
Got your things in the back and Im ready when you are
She said are you sure itll get us where were going
I said if theres one thing I know girl its gotten us this far
And I dont mean to hurry but Im ready when you are
Shes been playing in a room on the strip for ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
Shes been readin about Nashville and all the records that everybodys buying
Says Im a simple girl myself grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
Shes gone country look at them boots
Shes gone country back to her roots
Shes gone country a new kind of suit
Shes gone country here she comes
Well the folk scenes dead but hes holding out in the Village
Hes been writing songs speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says I dont believe in money
But a man could make him a killin
Cause some of that stuff dont sound much different than Dylan
I hear down there its changed you see
Well theyre not as backward as they used to be
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
He commutes to LA but hes got a house in the Valley
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just aint on the rally
And he says honey Im a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This aint no place for children
Lord it sounds so easy this shouldnt take long
Be back in the money in no time at all
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
Yeah hes gone country a new kind of walk
Hes gone country a new kind of talk
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country oh back to his roots
Hes gone country
Hes gone country
Everybodys gone country
Yeah weve gone county
The whole worlds gone country
Songwriter  Bob McDill
He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
Its another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin rays are wearin down his body
The diesels worth the price of gold
Its the cheapest grain hes ever sold
But hes still holdin on

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says Lord I never complain I never ask Why
Please dont let my dreams run dry
Underneath underneath this Amarillo Sky

That hail storm back in 
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays Please let my crops and children grow
Cause thats all he is ever known

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says Lord I never complain I never ask Why
Please dont let my dreams run dry
Underneath underneath this Amarillo Sky


And he takes the tractor another round Another round
Another round Another round another round
And he takes the tractor another round another round
He says I never complain I never ask Why
Please do not let my dreams run dry
Underneath underneath this Amarillo Sky
Underneath this Amarillo Sky
Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
  
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

Its gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call another bed I shouldnt crawl out of
At AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldnt do it but I did it again
And I know Ill be back tomorrow night oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off I dont even pack it
If you need me
Ill be where my reputation dont precede me

Maybe Im addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town where my past cant run me down
Another life another call another bed I shouldnt crawl out of
At AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldnt do it but I did it again
And I know Ill be gone tomorrow night
Mmm another vice

Standing at the sink not looking at the mirror
Dont know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes another vice
Ooh another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Rearview crosses
Railroad ties
Oh Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Lowbeam lights
God I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

In a sleepy town just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us we cant go back
Its what it is but God I miss

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat every line every word every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Every beat every line every word every single time
I just close my eyes and youre ridin shotgun
You and me baby on the run
I miss you baby
I miss you baby
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you til Is dead
Made you wait til our wedding night
Thats the first and the last time I wear white

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangmans noose
Cause Ill go to heaven or Ill go to hell
Before Ill see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Im gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Well
It wont be whiskey it wont be meth
Itll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Im gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two

I took your name when I took those vows
I meant em back then and I mean em right now
Oh right now

If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites

And let the stone say

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig uh
Therell be a stone right next to mine
Well be together til the end of time
Dont you go before I do
Im gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you til Is dead
Thought youd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But Im going to do one better hide the sun until you pray
Im a tornado looking for a soul to take

Youre going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did
Im going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit
Im a tornado looking for a man to break

Yeah Im going to lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure youre never found

Thought youd take a swing
Try another girl try another night
But its the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
Im a tornado more disturbed than an F

Hey Im gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Im gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure youre never found oh yeah

OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM

Im going to lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Im going to lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure youre never found

The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you aint got much longer
Til the rage rips off the roof
Im a tornado and Im coming after you

Oooo
Hmm
Oooo

Im going to lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
You know the lights of my hometown
They come alive when the sun goes down

We got the yard line on a Friday night
Mainstreet drag lined up with red taillights
And the dashboard glow from the radio

And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still I dont go there

Everybody says say something that says something
Say something that says something
Say something that says something
I dont wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere theres melody and harmony
For you and me tonight whoa
I hear them call my name

Everybody says Say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something
I dont want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant get help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have

Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have Maybe Im looking for something I cant have

Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
Yeah you know I love you in a tight dress
But youre oh my God slippin out of it
You turn me on girl you know you do
But you tear me up even better in boots
We aint gotta worry bout gettin dirty

Fair girl it aint even fair
When all it takes is you lettin down your hair
To drive me wild like you know you do
It works every time but even better in boots
We aint gotta worry bout gettin dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby put your Luccheses on
You know you want to
Cause we got a full moon
And its Friday night
Girl you got me so hooked
Aint nothin ever looked better in boots
We aint gotta worry bout gettin dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby put them Luccheses on
You know you want to
Cause we got a full moon
And its Friday night
Girl you got me so hooked
Aint nothin ever looked better in boots
Girl you got me so hooked
Aint nothin ever looked better in them boots

I need
Sometimes I drink to much sometimes I test your trust sometimes I dunno

Stood where you stood
Im hard to love hard to love you say that you need me I dont deserve
It but I love that you love me goood

Youre like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus I wish that I
Could be more like you

Stood where you stood
Im hard to love hard to love you say that you need me I dont deserve
It but I love that you love me Goood

Girl youve given me a million second chances and I dont ever wanna take
You for granted Im just a man Im just a man
Hard to love hard to love oh I dont make it easy and I couldnt do it if
I stood where you stood

Deserve it but I love that you love me good x
You love me good

Hey pretty girl lets build some dreams
And a house on a piece of land

And a fighters heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl you did so good

Hey pretty girl when I see the light
And its my time to go

A pretty little girl and a beautiful wife
Theres a want and theres a need
Theres a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

Ive got boots and shes got wings
Im hell on wheels and shes heavenly
Id die for her and she lives for me
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
Shes sweet Im wild were dangerous
Cowboys and angels

Im not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
Shes sweet Im wild were dangerous
Cowboys and angels

Theres a want and theres a need

Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Girl youre getting over him and Im getting over her
The eyes have it made aint gotta say a word
Misery loves company thats why its you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
Til we cant remember cant remember
What we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone like Ive been checking mine
Nobodys ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like its just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What were getin through

Keep playing them songs keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
Til we cant remember cant remember
What we came here to forget yeah
Just what we came here to forget

Looks like its just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What were getting through

Keep playing them songs keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
Til we cant remember cant remember
What we came here to forget

What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby baby
Thats what we came here to forget
I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man
It wasnt any secret Id be asking for her hand
I guess thats why he left me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was

Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad lookin up at him
In her eyes Im prince charming
But to him Im just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
Now aint she somethin son
I said Yeah shes quite a woman
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad lookin up at him
In her eyes Im prince charming
But to him Im just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

Oh he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
Thats when I could see it too

She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight
Runnin through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad lookin up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I cant blame the fellow
Im the one whos stealing  cinderella
The smile the charm the words the spark everything you had it
Guess I had a naive heart cause boy I let you have it
You said I was your only never thought youd leave me lonely

Youre just a lost boy with your head up in the clouds
Youre just a lost boy never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn theres no such place
As Neverland you dont understand
Youll never grow up
Youre never gonna be a man Peter Pan

Deep down I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now its happily ever never I guess now I know better

Youre just a lost boy with your head up in the clouds
Youre just a lost boy never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn theres no such place
As Neverland you dont understand
Youll never grow up
Youre never gonna be a man Peter Pan

Youre just a lost boy yeah I know who you are
And you dont know what you lost boy too busy chasing stars

And youre always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn theres no such place
As Neverland you dont understand
Youll never grow up
Youre never gonna be a man
Youre never grow up yeah
Youre never gonna be a man Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man
Oh babe

Wide awake waitin on a goodnight kiss
Sippin ninety proof talkin to the moon
Countin down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin me a text sayin

Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you wont say the words that i want but you flirt when youre drinkin
I see those bubbles pop up like youre texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then lets get to what were doing here

Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand

Yeah I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
Im asking you baby cause im tired of asking myself

Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing are we dancing in the kitchen baby tell me what it is or what it isnt
Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand

Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand
Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honkytonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

She said rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Yesterdays nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While Im wearing out roads dont you know that Im sure missing you
If I leave youll be wondering when Ill be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

She said rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Come on

Hey rodeo man where are you going
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider
I got that real good feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin on s pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow row row my boat
Floatin down the Flint River catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah thats my kind of night

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hiphop mixtape
Little Conway a little TPain might just make it rain
You can hang your tshirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out

Taking down your neighbor wont take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger poking someone elses fire
Ive never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you aint got nothing nice to say dont say nothing at all

Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Nobodys perfect weve all lost and weve all lied
Most of us have cheated the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
Weve all got dirty laundry hanging on the line

Just hoe your own row yeah and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Pouring salt in my sugar wont make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard aint gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldnt know about the rocks in your shoes
So Ill just do me and honey you can just do you

Just hoe your own row yeah and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Beautiful crazy she cant help but amaze me
The way that she dances aint afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God Im yours

Thank God Im yours
Thank God Im yours
Thank God Im yours
Some people dont know when to quit and thats why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem they cant handle it
But that aint why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was but ooh that would be a lie

Ive been sober cause there aint no hangover like you girl
No no no
Baby can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof yeah
Girl every time you do
I just end up head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
Ive been sober since you broke my heart in two
Cause drunk me cant get over you There aint no hangover like you
Cant get over cant get over There aint no hangover like you
Oh no no no

All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and Im picking up the phone tryin not to go home without you
And that aint nothin but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt ooh hurts it aint worth another drink

Ive been sober cause there aint no hangover like you girl
No no no
Baby can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof yeah
Girl every time you do

Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin mad
Bitchin and moanin on and on
Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratchoff ticket
I bought two packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea seorita fishing down in Panama
And I aint gotta see my
Exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
Oh Lord when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And its crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
Its got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooters parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I aint gotta see my
Exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
Oh Lord when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Well Ive been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratchoff ticket
Bought two packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea seorita fishing down in Panama
And I aint gotta see my
Exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
Oh Lord when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord hes lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

Country must be country wide
In every state
Theres a station
Playing Cash Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

Theres cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There aint no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It aint where
Its how you live
We werent raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see whats wrong
And we know whats right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

Country must be country wide
In every state
Theres a station
Playing Cash Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

Theres cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There aint no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

Country must be country wide
In every state
Theres a station
Playing Cash Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

Theres cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There aint no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

There aint no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom
Red sky faded to black
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didnt care if we were spinnin wheels
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Yeaahee
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Goin nowhere fast
I heard a freight train out across the way
I heard a woman sing amazing grace
I heard a night bird call to its mate
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard freedom break its chain
I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lightin and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldnt see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes He did

I think about the years I spent just passing through
Id like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
Youve been there you understand
Its all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes He did

Now Im just rolling home
Into my lovers arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts I wear Tshirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
You slip your finger through the tear in my tshirt
You stirrin up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin cause you know that its workin
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldnt sing this song without you if I tried
Lets light it up like its our last night

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
Im just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down

Girl when you want it
You know that Im on it
You know that I love lovin up on you
Lets hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like its our last chance

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin in my bed
Im just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me with me
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me against me
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me with me
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  against me

Were just hanging around
Burnin it down
Sippin on some cold Jack Daniels
Jammin to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
Im just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl lets keep burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down
Burnin it down burnin it down burnin it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me with me
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me
My oh my youre so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But Ive not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when Im not looking
Do you pour a little something on the rocks
Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress do you leave a path
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath
My oh my youre so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But Ive not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when Im not looking

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

Do you break things when you get mad
Eat a box of chocolates cause youre feeling bad
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails
Call up mamma when all else fails
Who are you when Im not around
When the door is locked and the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly
And when it feels just right are you thinking of me

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

My oh my youre so goodlooking
But who are you when Im not looking
Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
Theres the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the games about to start

I dont really know how I got here
But Im sure glad that I did
And its crazy to think that one little thing
Couldve changed all of it
Maybe it didnt turn out like I planned
Maybe thats why Im such such a lucky man

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to
This

Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter

All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought Id never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you
I didnt understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

How I cried when my mama passed away
But now Ive got an angel looking out for me today
So nothings a mistake

For every stoplight I didnt make
Every chance I did or I didnt take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didnt know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

It led me here to
This
It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go if we
Cleaned it up and got it running
Daddys old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it
To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Like a storm time rolls on
You cant hit pause thats just the deal
Most days in life dont stand out
But lifes about those days that we all like
Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
til the Alabama sun was breaking
Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind
Tonight Im in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Talladega
Talladega
Down a back road
Long hot summer
A couple kids runnin loose and wild
He kissed her
She said mister
Take an inch and Ill give you a mile
I aint here to do anything halfway
Dont give a damn what anyone might say
I just wanna free fall for a while

That rebel moon is shinin
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin down that crazy spark
Ill follow you where youre leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin baby
Wild at heart

About midnight he tells her

Ill follow you where youre leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin baby

It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh a sailors sky made a perfect sunset
And thats the day Ill never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart dont forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked I couldnt believe just what I saw
She said I bet you dont remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart dont forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart dont forget no a heart dont forget
I said a heart dont forget something like that
Oh not something like that
You say what if I hurt you what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I dont need you
What if this goes south what if I mess you up
You say what if I break your heart in two then what

Well I hear you girl I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up I gotta ask

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it what if its meant to be
What if I aint one of them fools just playin some game
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in
And the stars line up and its our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls sky falls
Or the sun stops burnin
We could worry about them what ifs til the world stops turnin
Or I could kiss you you should kiss me
What if you liked it bet Id like it
Well we aint never gonna know unless we try it

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it what if its meant to be
What if I aint one of them fools just playin some game
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in
And the stars line up and its our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away
Awe yeah
Cmon

You say what if I hurt you what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I dont need you
Damn

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it what if its meant to be
What if I aint one of them fools just playin some game
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in
And the stars line up and its our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Away away
What if
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own dont fill up half
But dont you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

On a lonely highway stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
Youre right there in everything I do

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything Ill ever need
Im carrying your love with me
Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car

Well its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
Itll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look

Well its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Hehyeee

You know you got a job and a little bitty cheque
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
Its all part of a little bitty scheme

Its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
We all want what we aint got
Our favorite doors are always locked
On a higher hill with a taller top
We all want what we aint got
We aint happy where we are
Theres greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We aint happy where we are

All I want is what I had
Ill trade it all just to get her back
Shes moving on but I guess Im not
We all want what we aint got

We all wish it didnt hurt
When you try your best and it doesnt work
And goodbyes such a painful word
We all wish it didnt hurt

All I want is what I had
Ill trade it all just to get her back
Shes moving on but I guess Im not
We all want what we aint got

All I want is what I had
Ill trade it all just to get her back
Shes moving on but I guess Im not
We all want what we aint got

I wanted the world until my whole world stopped
You know a love like that aint easily forgot
I guess we all want what we aint got
Yeah we all want what we aint got
I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says follow your dreams
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate

Born again in a church where the steeples white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 
Didnt make sense til I found you

I could search the world from south to north
But Ive already found what Im looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes yeah its all so clear
Every time you smile I know why Im here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you

I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby where you been

Cause I could search the world from south to north
But Ive already found what Im looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes yeah its all so clear
Every time you smile I know why Im here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you

Cause I could search the world from south to north
But Ive already found what Im looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes yeah its all so clear
Every time you smile I know why Im here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you I was born to love you

She wants to get married she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people save her daddy some money

Ooh she got it all planned out
Yeah I can see it all right now

Ill wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back
Ill do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah she wanna get married
But she dont wanna marry me

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah I kinda freaked out weve been friends for forever
And Id always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite I knew it was too late

And I know her daddys been dreading this day
Oh but he dont know he aint the only one giving her away

Ill wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back
Ill do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah she wanna get married
But she dont wanna marry me

Bet she got on her dress now welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her get it off of my chest now
But I aint gonna mess it up so I wish her the best now

So Im in my black suit black tie hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
Ill try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah she wanna get married
Yeah she gonna get married
But she aint gonna marry me
Whoa but she aint gonna marry me no
I bet you have never heard ole Marshal Dillon say
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down would you marry me
If I ask you twice and beg you pretty please
She should of said Yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart was not in it
He just stole a kiss as he road away
He never hung his hat up at Kittys place

I should been a cowboy
I should learned to rope and ride
Wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing young girls hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should have been a cowboy

I might of had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west young man have not you been told
California is full of whiskey women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart
I do not know why I act the way I do
Like I am not got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy
I guess that is just the cowboy in me
I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

The urge to run the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things Ive done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess thats just the cowboy in me
The urge to run the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things Ive done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess thats just the cowboy in me

Girl I know there is times you must have thought
There am not a line you have drawn I have not crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that is just the cowboy in you

We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess thats just the cowboy in us all
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Right outside of this one church town
Theres a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin
Got a deed to the land but it aint my ground
This is Gods country
We pray for rain and thank Him when its fallen
Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess thats why they call it Gods country

I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin back in the  on the muddy riverside
Gettin baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind thatll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didnt stick around
This is Gods country

We turned the dirt and worked until the weeks done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
Cause were proud to be from Gods country Yeah yeah

I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin back in the  on the muddy riverside
Gettin baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind thatll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didnt stick around
This is Gods country Yeah

This is Gods country
Gods country

I dont care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When its my time lay me six feet deep
In Gods country Yeah yeah

I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin back in the  on the muddy riverside
Gettin baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind thatll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didnt stick around
This is Gods country Gods country
Yeah I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin back in the  on the muddy riverside
Gettin baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind thatll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didnt stick around
This is Gods country
The jokes on me and it aint funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
Ive heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes

A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

Id laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
Im walking talking drinking proof
A clich in a corner booth
Aint nothing new

A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar


A guy walks into a bar orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh cry hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar
Im in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why

Dont know why
I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
Its not new
But itll do  to  in  oh

Im in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why

Cant be late
I leave in plenty of time
Shaking hands with the clock
I cant stop
Im on a roll and Im ready to rock oh

Im in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why

I hear a voice
It says Im running behind
I better pick up my pace
Its a race
And there aint no room
For someone in second place

Im in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why
We go out to a party somewhere
The moment we walk in the door
People stop and everybody stares
She dont know what theyre staring for

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so

There she goes just walking down the street
And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her she just cant see
What the fuss is all about

And she dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so

Morning comes and her hairs all a mess
Thats when she thinks she looks her worst
Its times like this she dont know why
I cant take my eyes off her

Cause she dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so
She looked so good moving across the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holding hands and laughing like we used to
I got my best smile on but its no disguise
It dont hide the pain in these eyes

I did her so wrong for so long
Turned my back on her love now shes long gone
I did my part to break her heart
She walked out on me and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh she used to be mine

Its taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off of my face
I cant keep from looking back over my shoulder
At the lucky man taking my place
Oh if it werent for my pride Id probably take off running
Guess what Im feeling is what I got coming


Oh she used to be mine
She used to be mine
Am I dreaming or stupid
I think Ive been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall dark and handsome man
And Ive been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set my feet wet
But he dont even know it yet
But no one needs to know right now

Ill tell him someday some way somehow
But Im gonna keep it a secret for now

I want bells to ring a choir to sing
The white dress the guests the cake the car the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

Ill tell him someday some way somehow
But im gonna keep it a secret for now

Well have a little girl a little boy
A little benji we call leroy
But no one needs to know right now

And Im not lonely anymore at night
And he dont know only only he can make it right
And Im not lonely anymore at night
And he dont know only only he can make it right

Im not dreaming or stupid
But boy have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

Theres your record 
Yup there you go dudes
Wont you please turn up the lights
I cant hardly see
Thank you kindly but that dont help
Maybe its just me
It seems Ive had this problem since
My baby packed up to leave
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now were far apart
Night is fallin in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin in my heart
Could you pull those curtains back
And let the morning in
Whats that you say Oh is that a fact
Well it still seems mighty dim
I guess Ill just have to live this way
Unless my baby come back again
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now were far apart
Night is fallin in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin in my heart
And as the last ray of love
Slowly disappears
Alone in this endless night
I just see one thing clear
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now were far apart
Night is fallin in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin in my heart
You may think that Im talking foolish
Youve heard that Im wild and Im free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
Youre not just time that Im killing
Im no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  oh baby

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Ill be happy to tell you again
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey I dont care I aint in love with your hair
And if it all fell out well Id love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well its easy to see its happening to me
Ive already forgotten every woman but you  oh darling

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Well just listen to how this song ends
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now lord I remember how
Couldnt get enough of kissing do you know how much youre missing
No you dont but I do
The days like a slow train trickle by
And even the words that I write refuse to fly
All I can hear is your song haunting me
Cant get the melody out of my head you see
Distractions are amusing do you know how much youre losing
No you dont but I do
But I do and I wonder if Im past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you do you know how much I love you
No you dont but I do
I swore Id never fall like this again
Fools like me never win came to my knees again
Cant close the door on likely hood
Things might be just as good I always believed they would
Gotta let your love invite me baby do you think it might be
No you dont but I do
But I do and I wonder if Im past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you do you know how much I love you
No you dont but I do
But I do and I wonder if Im past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you do you know how much I love you
No you dont but I do
I know you dont but I do
I know you dont but I do
Looking at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Every night now since I been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
Think about you on your mamas front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Willie Nelson
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive
But I am still alive
Kris Kristofferson
I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
Waylon Jennings
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Ill always be around and around and around and around and around
Johnny Cash
Ill fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
Ill find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And Ill be back again and again and again and again and again
Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said Can you help me Creole
I got a little girl waiting on me and I want to treat her right

He said I got what you need son as we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time

You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said Now heres something special
Its just been waiting for a night like tonight

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time

Youre still with me
Weve made some memories
After all these years
Theres one thing Ive found
Some say good love
Is like a fine wine
It keeps getting better
As the days go by

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time
Dont let it fool you
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that

And I said hey pretty lady wont you gimme a sign

Shes got ruby red lips blond hair blue eyes
And Im about to bid my heart goodbye

Well the auctioneer was goin bout a mile a minute
He was takin bids and callin them out loud
And I guess I was really gettin in it
Cause I just shouted out above the crowd

And I said hey pretty lady wont you gimme a sign
Id give anything to make you mine all mine
Ill do your biddin and be at your beck and call
Yeah Ive never seen anyone lookin so fine
Man I gotta have her shes a one of a kind

Well she won my heart it was no contest
With her ruby red lips blond hair blue eyes
Well Im about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah we found love on the auction block
And I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day

When I said hey pretty lady wont you gimme a sign
Id give anything to make you mine all mine
Ill do your biddin and be at your beck and call
Yeah Ive never seen anyone lookin so fine
Man I gotta have her shes a one of a kind
Im goin once goin twice
Im sold on the lady in the second row
Shes an eight shes a nine shes a ten I know
Shes got ruby red lips blond hair blue eyes
And Im about to bid my heart goodbye
She left without leaving a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured shed gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If youre calling bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night Im bowling
If youve got something to sell
Youre wasting your time Im not buying
If its anybody else wait for the tone
You know what to do
And PS if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldnt believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didnt know what shed say
But she heard three rings and then

If its Friday night Im at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday if it dont rain
Im headed out to the lake
And Ill be gone all weekend long
But Ill call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And PS if this is Austin
I still love you

Well this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If youre calling bout my heart its still yours
I shouldve listened to it a little more
Then it wouldnt have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine youre talking to
Cant you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water thats no longer runnin under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank Im So Lonesome I Could Cry
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Ill be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Ill be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Neon lights flashing bright til youre almost hypnotized
Waitress short skirt gets hit on by every guy
Comin and goin always rollin with the flow
Bartender pour our drinks Cdigo do a shot
You think youre tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says youre not
You step outside thinkin youre gonna show em you are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Well be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Well be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
I cant hide the way I feel about you anymore
I cant hold the hurt inside keep the pain out of my eyes anymore
My tears no longer waiting my resistance aint that strong
My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And Im tired of pretending I dont love you anymore
Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you
Cause theres no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart cant take the beating not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I cant keep pretending I dont love you anymore
Ive got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life
My tears no longer waiting oohh my resistance aint that strong
But my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And Im tired of pretending I dont love you anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Katies sittin on the old front porch
Watchin the chickens peck the ground
There aint a whole lot goin on tonight
In this onehorse town
Over yonder comin up the road
In a beatup Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy hes layin on the horn
Splashin through the mud and the muck
Her daddy says he aint worth a lick
When it comes to brains he got the short end of the stick
But Katies young and man she just dont care
Shed follow Tommy anywhere
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
Shes gonna marry that boy someday
Katie and Tommy at the drivein movie
Parked in the very last row
Theyre too busy holdin on to one another
To even care about the show
Later on outside the Tastee Freeze
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says my high school ring will have to do
Til I can buy a wedding band
Her daddy says he aint worth a lick
When it comes to brains he got the short end of the stick
But Katies young and man she just dont care
Shed follow Tommy anywhere
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
Shes gonna marry that boy someday
Her daddys waitin up til half past twelve
When they come sneakin up the walk
He says young lady get on up to your room
While me and Junior have a talk
Mama breaks in says dont lose your temper
It wasnt very long ago
When you yourself was just a hayseed plowboy
Who didnt have a row to hoe
My daddy said you wasnt worth a lick
When it came to brains you got the short end of the stick
But he was wrong and honey you are too
Katie looks at Tommy like I still look at you
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Whats meant to be will always find a way
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Shes in love with the boy
Whats meant to be will always find a way
Shes gonna marry that boy someday
Shes in love with the boy
Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well it wasnt two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a redeye midnight flight
She held Wandas hand and they worked out a plan
And it didnt take em long to decide

That Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
Those blackeyed peas
They tasted all right to me Earl
Youre feeling weak
Why dont you lay down and sleep Earl
Aint it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said Thank You ladies if you hear from him let us know

Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they dont lose any sleep at night cause

Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Lets go out to the lake Earl
Well pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk Earl
Well is that all right
Good lets go for a ride Earl
Hey

Well hey hey hey
Aw hey hey hey
Well hey hey hey
I bet you have never heard ole Marshal Dillon say
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down would you marry me
If I ask you twice and beg you pretty please
She should of said Yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart was not in it
He just stole a kiss as he road away
He never hung his hat up at Kittys place

I should been a cowboy
I should learned to rope and ride
Wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing young girls hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should have been a cowboy

I might of had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west young man have not you been told
California is full of whiskey women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart
I see the sunrise creepin in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then shes gone again and

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller

My heartbeats rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller

When Im gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rollin til Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey I dont know
Where Im goin but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller oh Im a traveller
You keep callin me
On the telephone
You say youre all alone
Well thats real sad
And you keep leavin
Notes stuck on my door
Guess youre hungry for some more
Girl thats too bad
Cause I aint that lonely yet
No I aint that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh I aint that lonely yet
Once there was this
Spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web
Of love and lies
She spun her chains
Around my heart and soul
Never to let go
Oh but I survived
Chorus
Theres nothin left you can do
To try and bring me round
Cause everything you do
Just brings me down whoa
Chorus x
This town aint big this town aint small
Its a little of both they say
Our ball club may be minor league but at least its triple A
We sit below the Marlboro man above the right field wall
We do the wave all by ourself
Hey ump a blind man couldve made that call
We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher whats his name
Well we cant even spell it
We dont worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats
The game was close well call it a win
Go off to toast the boys again
That local band is back in town
They got a kinda minor league sound
Theyre not that bad theyre not that good
But all in all its understood
We wanna dance they wanna play
We wouldnt have it any other way
We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher whats his name
Well we cant even spell it
We dont worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats
Cheap seats
Now the majors called up ol whats his name
And one more buildin rises tall
And suddenly were all grown up
And this old town not quite so small
But Ill always miss the middle size town
In the middle of the middlewest
With no name pitchers and local bands
And mustard and relish and all the rest
We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher whats his name
Well we cant even spell it
We dont worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats
Cheap seats
I keep hearin your concern about my happiness
But all that thought youve given me is conscience I guess
If I were walkin in your shoes I wouldnt worry none
While you and your friends are worryinbout me Im havinlots of fun
Chorus
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fiftyone
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me
Ive nothin to do
Last night I dressed in tails pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream its hard to slow this swinger down
So please dont give a thought to me Im really doin fine
You can always find me here and havin quite a time
Chorus
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fiftyone
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me
Ive nothin to do
Its good to see you I must go I know I look a fright
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
Chorus
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fiftyone
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me
Ive nothin to do
Now dont tell me
Ive nothin to do
Midnight in Montgomery Silver Eagle lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Years Eve show
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up I found his name and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots a Nudie suit and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend its good to see you its nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone was he ever really there

Cause its midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
Cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
Hes always singing there

Well I climbed back on that Eagle took one last look around
Through red tail lights a shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan Im so lonesome I could cry

Cause its midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
Cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
Hes always singing there

Yeah hes always singing there
Oh Hanks always singing there
People are talking talking bout people
I hear them whisper you wont believe it
They think were lovers kept under cover
I just ignore it but they keep saying
We laugh just a little too loud
Stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe theyre seein something we dont darling
Lets give em something to talk about
Lets give em something to talk about
Lets give em something to talk about
How about love
I feel so foolish I never noticed
Youd act so nervous could you be falling for me
It took the rumor to make me wonder
Now Im convinced Im going under
Thinkin bout you every day
Dream bout you every night
Im hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it lets really show it darling
Lets give em something to talk about
A little mystery to figure out babe
Lets give em something to talk about
How about love
Lets give em something to talk about babe
A little mystery to figure out
Lets give em something to talk about
How about love
Ooh listen to em baby
A little mystery wont hurt em
Lets give em something to talk about
How about our love love love love
If you really want to know
She comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K is her favorite song
If you play it you might have a chance
Tonight shes only sippin white wine
Shes friendly and fun lovin
Most of the time
But dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Heres a glass of chablis some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she wont need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her hearts on the mend
So if you ever come back to see her again
Dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
But dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin with my eyes wide open
Ill do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin
Or spend our whole lives hopin
End the end were left with
The one we chose
So Ill do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin back or followin someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that aint
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin with my eyes wide open
Ill do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin
Or spend our whole lives hopin
End the end were left with
The one we chose
So Ill do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
We can do some livin
Or spend our whole lives hopin
In the end were left with
The ones we chose
So Ill do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Theres an Elvis movie on the marquee sign
Weve all seen at least three times
Everybodys broke Bobbys got a buck
Put a dollars worth of gas in his pickup truck
Were going ninety miles an hour down a deadend road
Whats the hurry son where you gonna go
Were gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
Its a small town Saturday night
Its a small town Saturday night
Lucys got her lipstick on a little too bright
Bobbys gettin drunk and lookin for a fight
Liquor on his breath and trouble on his mind
And Lucys just a kid along for the ride
Got a sixpack of beer and a bottle of wine
Gotta be bad just to have a good time
Theyre gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
Its a small town Saturday night
Its a small town Saturday night
Bobby told Lucy The world aint round
Drops off sharp at the edge of town
Lucy you know the world must be flat
Cause when people leave town they never come back
They go ninety miles an hour to the city limits sign
Put the pedal to the metal fore they change their mind
They howl at the moon shoot out the light
Its a small town Saturday night
They howl at the moon shoot out the light
Yeah its a small town Saturday night
Its a small town Saturday night
Its a small town Saturday night
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didnt have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said Your Pas run off and Im real sick
And the babys gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
To thine own self be true
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
Across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking mama What do I do
She said Be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
Theyll be nice to you

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well its up to you
Now dont let me down now
Your mamas gonna move you uptown

Well that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I aint been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasnt very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama had been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was going to be a lady someday
Though I didnt know when or how
But I couldnt see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I mightve been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down

It wasnt long after that benevolent man took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea In a five room hotel suite Yes she was
I charmed a king congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I aint done bad She aint done bad

Now in this world theres a lot of selfrighteous hypocrites
That call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I aint had to worry about nothing
For now or fifteen years
Well I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mamas voice ringing in my ear

Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Oh heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well its up to you
Now dont let me down honey
Mamas gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did

Just like every locks got to have a key
Every river flows looking for the sea
And when you plant a seed it reaches for the sky
Thats just the way it is nobody wonders why
Like coffee needs a cup you know that it aint much good without it
We were meant to be together no doubt about it
Like a hammer and a nail socks and shoes
We go hand in hand like a rhythm and blues
What good is a man who hasnt got a dream
Bout as good as a car with no gasoline
Youre the one Im dreaming of got to have your love cant live without it
We were meant to be together no doubt about it
No there aint no doubt about it
Something was missing it was making me blue
But all I ever needed was you
Just like every locks got to have a key
Every river flows lookin for the sea
And when you plant a seed it reaches for the sky
Thats just the way it is girl with you and I
Like coffee needs a cup you know that it aint much good without it
We were meant to be together no doubt about it
No there aint no doubt about it
Like a hammer and a nail socks and shoes
We go hand in hand like a rhythm and blues
What good is a man who hasnt got a dream
Bout as good as a car with no gasoline
Youre the one Im dreaming of got to have your love cant live without it
We were meant to be together no doubt about it
Swear one Bud Light sip and I buzz back
One Jack and Diane and Im in the past
Lost in the middle of seventeen
Yeah everything about you and me

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song

I still see your hand out on the wind
That dashboard blue on your skin
That fire that touch that wild that rush
Yeah that was us running down a high
Wish all it took to go back in time

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song

That fire that touch that wild that rush
That high that Im still on
Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
Was a tank a gas and a radio song

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like its right there
Windshield hearts midnight air
Any good thing it dont last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
On a warm summers evenin on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns astarin out the window at the darkness
Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said Son Ive made a life out of readin peoples faces
And knowin what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you dont mind my sayin I can see youre out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey Ill give you some advice

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said If youre gonna play the game boy
You gotta learn to play it right

You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin
Is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

You got to know when to hold em When to hold em
Know when to fold em When to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done
You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done
Oh Im sorry I forgot where I was
I try to think about Elvis
Memphis
Oprah in the afternoon
I try to think about palm trees
Fig leaves
The creature from the black lagoon
I try to think about high heels
And good deals
Anything to get me through
I just cant concentrate
Youre all I think about these days
I try to contemplate the cosmos
What goes
Round and round the sky at night
I try to think about champagne
Freight trains
Slowly rolling out of sight
I try to focus on the headlines
Street crimes
Everytime I think I might
I just cant concentrate
Youre all I think about these days
My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
Come on Patty get it together
I try to think about Shakespeare
Leap year
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones
I try to think about hairdos
Tattoos
Sushi bars and saxophones
I try to think about the talk shows
New clothes
But I guess I should have known
I just cant concentrate
Youre all I think about these days
Youre all I think about these days
Pour me pour me
Pour me pour me another shot of whiskey
Bartender hit me one more time
He left I cried
Im lost inside wont ya help me
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time

Well I dont want to listen to the old jukebox
So dontcha put no quarters in the slot
I dont wanna talk and I dont wanna dance
I dang sure aint lookin for romance

I dont wanna hang out with the crowd
I dont wanna party and get real loud
Believe me when I tell ya that Ive thought this through
Theres only one thing that I want you to do

Pour me pour me
Pour me pour me another shot of whiskey
Bartender hit me one more time
He left I cried
Im lost inside wont ya help me
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time

Heres my story its sad but its true
Theres so many things that I never knew
He loved to party and he loved to dance
He loved to get loud every time he had the chance

I always thought he was a simpleminded Okie
Little did I know he was the king of karaoke
He was everything that a man should be
Problem was that it wasnt with me

Pour me pour me
Pour me pour me another shot of whiskey
Bartender hit me one more time
He left I cried
Im lost inside wont ya help me
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time

Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a twostep partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up Im going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from aLouisiana tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was going to go
Down Highway  past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I wont forget
To send you a card with my regrets
Because Im never going to come back home

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a twostep partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up Im going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from aLouisiana tonight

They got a alligator stew and a crayfish pie
A Gulf storm blowing into town tonight
Living on the deltas quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
But here up north its a cold cold rain
And there aint no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says BeauSoleil is coming into town
Baby lets go down

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a twostep partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up Im going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from aLouisiana tonight

Bring your mama bring your papa bring your sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 
You going to feel a little bit young again
Well you learned to dance with your rock and roll
You learned to swing with a dosido
But you learn to love at the faissodo
When you hear a little Jolie Blon

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a twostep partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up Im going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from aLouisiana tonight
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

Ive never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I dont know how you do what you do
Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I dont know how you do what you do
Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by you

With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh every little thing that you do
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by
By you
She turned fifteen with great expectations
Her older brother knew that somethin was up
He caught her going through his record collection
Lookin at Hendrix like a lovesick pup
She begged and she pleaded till Dad finally listened
He drove in the car down to Sears Roebuck
He bought her that guitar and that was the beginning
Now shes down in the cellar with the amp turned up

Girls with guitars
Daddys little angel
Girls with guitars
Whats the world coming to
Girls with guitars
Mothers tend to worry about
Girls with guitars

Well Saturday nights she followed her brother
It was socks and stockings on the old gym floor
While everybody danced to garage band covers
She was checking out riffs and memorizing chords
She didnt care at all for the football heroes
She didnt even notice the basketball stars
Boys as a species were all a bunch of zeros
Except for the ones that played that guitar

Girls with guitars
She wasnt any debutante
Girls with guitars
She didnt go out for cheer leading
Girls with guitars
Boys are kind of nervous round
Girls with guitars

She went off to college she got her degree
Her parents breathed a sigh of great relief
Daddys thinking law school mothers thinking medicine
Daughters thinking how she gonna break the news to them
Now theres an old Chevy van just sitting in the driveway
Filled to the gills with all of her stuff
She cut a deal with her brother to drive it up the highway
She figures New York City is close enough
She gets the audition through a friend of a friend
Whos checking out her legs saying this will never work
She flips on her boogie and turns to the band
Gives a little grin and blows away the jerk

Girls with guitars
Now everybodys rockin
Girls with guitars
There ought to be a song about
Girls with guitars
Theres just no stopping those
Girls with guitars
Get your money for nothin and your guys for free
Last updated  PM MST
If youre gonna play in Texas
You gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot
But not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for Faded Love
And lets all dance
If youre gonna play in Texas
You gotta have a fiddle in the band

I remember down in Houston
We were puttin on a show
When a cowboy in the back stood up
And yelled Cotton Eye Joe
He saidWe love what youre doing
Boys dont get us wrong
Theres just something missing in your song

So we dusted off our boots
And put our cowboy hats on straight
Them Texans raised the roof
When Jeff opened up his case
Say yall all want to twostep
Say you wanna dosdos
Well heres a fiddling song before we go
God and country music
Like whiskey and a prayer
Like Johnny Cashs arm round Billy Graham
God and country music
They both never really change
You find em when you need em where you stand

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin
God and country music
God and country music

God and country music
They both show you the truth
Theyve seen the low of the valley
And the highs of the mountains too
Folded hands and guitar strings
Jukebox preachers and angels sing
Call you like they knew ya
Between the hell and hallelujah

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its still livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin
God and country music
God and country music

Theres always lost in the found
And darkness in the I saw the light
Its still livin in those small towns
In some church or backroad honkytonk tonight
Its a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water theres two things still worth savin

I graduated with  sheep I was the black one
If there was a reputation to be out in this town I had the bad one
I was born in the wrong place in the wrong time
But sometimes the wrong way makes you the right kind

I was all in a hurry
And if I got past then I wont stop like I would get a head start on anything that hurt me
Anywhere I go dont feel like you was that good or bad
I dont know if Im wrong in a way
I dont know if Im wrong and told ya
I guess thats what you get when youre born
And stuck in California
California Missouri

I just really hope one day that youre gonna love me
I was California dreamin from the middle of the country
I look for you in the best of them
And every face and city skyline
I got out of your way
But did you get out of my

I was all in a hurry
And if I got past then I wont stop like I would get a head start on anything that hurt me
Anywhere I go dont feel like you was that good or bad
I dont know if Im wrong in a way
I dont know if Im wrong and told ya
I guess thats what you get when youre born
And stuck in California
California Missouri

Aint no shining lights or palm trees
Theres more stars in the sky than stars in the streets
Its bittersweet its bittersweet its bittersweet
Theres too many goals and memories

I was all in a hurry
And if I got past then I wont stop like I nothing could hurt me
Anywhere I go dont feel like you was that good or bad
I dont know if Im wrong in a way
I dont know if Im wrong and told ya
I guess thats what you get when youre born
And stuck in California

A dark cloud ahangin out over my head
I woke up this morning to an empty bed
Why she left me is hard to say
Well is this fate or just a bad day
Is this bad luck or just bad timin
Or is it the lies I told its hard to say
Can you get back whats gone They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
Well some things its hard to say
Thumb up in the air and Im ahitchin a ride
Plenty cars passin but Im on the wrong side
If I cross over will they go my way
Is this fate or just a bad day
Is this bad luck or just bad timin
Or is it the lies I told its hard to say
Can you get back whats gone They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
Is this bad luck or just bad timin
Or is it the lies I told its hard to say
Can you get back whats gone They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
I aint even gonna ask you

Girl if I ever saw one thats an
I cant believe I did that look
You look like something
That the cat drug in
So I wont kick you while youre down
Just let me tell you friend to friend
About a block Ive been around
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But theres no use crying
Over spilled perfume
Theres a big difference
Between lonely and
Lonely for way too long
And I knew when he made his move
You werent feeling all that strong
So I bit my tongue
Cuz I saw it coming
She danced so close to him
Its two steps forward and three steps back
When a heart is on the mend
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But theres no use crying
Over spilled perfume
You fell in a moment of weakness
When youve just gotta
Pull yourself back up
Dry your morningafter tears
Cuz whats done is done
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But theres no use crying
Over spilled perfume
No use crying over
No use crying over
No use crying over spilled perfume
Im a thousand miles from nowhere
Time dont matter to me
Cause Im a thousand miles from nowhere
And theres no place I want to be
I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel cruel things that you said
Chorus
Ive got bruises on my memory
Ive got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror theres a vision
Of what used to be a man
Chorus x
Im a thousand miles from nowhere
Im a thousand miles from nowhere
Whose bed have your boots been under
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal i wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
Whose bed have your boots been under

Dont look so lonely
Dont act so blue
I know Im not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
Ive seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal i wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissing
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missing baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

I heard youve been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And Ive seen you walking
With longlegs Louise
And you werent just talking
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal i wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissing
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missing baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

Come on boots
So next time youre lonely
Dont call on me
Try the operator
Maybe shell be free

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal i wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissing
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missing baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

I wanna know whose bed baby
Whoa baby tell me
Whose bed yes i wanna know
You better start talking
Or you better start walking
I took a walk in the rain one day
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldnt tempt fate
And for them I cannot disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances
I dont mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
Hed show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette

I take my chances
Yes forgiveness doesnt come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

Ive crossed lines with words and wire
And both have cut me deep
Ive been frozen out and Ive been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
Ill play from either side

I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I take my chances
Yeah I dont cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

Ill take my chances
Ill take my chances
When I woke up this morning
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
I found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realize
Youre gone
Tell me I was dreaming
That you didnt leave me here to cry
You didnt say
You dont love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didnt say goodbye
Im in a state of confusion
I hope things arent what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
Youre home
Tell me I was dreaming
That you didnt leave me here to cry
You didnt say
You dont love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didnt say goodbye
Tell me I was dreaming tell me I was dreaming
That you didnt leave me here to cry
You didnt say
You dont love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Oh tell me that you didnt say goodbye
Darlin tell me
You didnt say
Goodbye
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
Told him just how our story ends
Did all I could to try to make it work
But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

Ive been at the house climbin them walls
Checkin that calendar xin days off
Hit another bar call another friend
Throw a few down tell the story again

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Im finally gettin out back into the world
Life is good I met me a girl
She got a beautiful heart eyes are blue
I dont hardly ever think about you

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to

Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
Sometimes I break down and cry

Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
Hey hey what can I say
I can just lie and say its all okay
Oh oh what can I do
Been goin through Hell gettin over you
But it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
No it dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
It dont hurt it dont hurt like it used to
She makes his coffee she makes his bed
She does the laundry she keeps him fed
When she was twentyone she wore her mothers lace
She said forever with a smile upon her face
She does the carpool she PTAs
Doctors and dentists she drives all day
When she was twentynine she delivered number three
And every Christmas card showed a perfect family

Everything runs right on time years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines He thinks hell keep her
Everything is so benign safest place youll ever find
God forbid you change your mind
He thinks hell keep her

She packs his suitcase she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirtysix she met him at their door
She said Im sorry I dont love you anymore

Everything runs right on time years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines He thinks hell keep her
Everything is so benign safest place youll ever find
God forbid you change your mind
He thinks hell keep her

For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
Now shes in the typing pool at minimum wage

Everything runs right on time years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines He thinks hell keep her
Everything is so benign safest place youll ever find
At least until you change your mind
He thinks hell keep her
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a tenfoot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn kids and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it aint no use
There aint no paint in the world thatll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
Ah paint it green boy
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
John Deere green
Well my names John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year
Hed buy a hundred pound of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
Its before my time but Ive been told
He never came back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Masons Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin sound
Then the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin knew something wasnt right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin down Copperhead Road

I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
And I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
And now the DEAs got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like Im back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie dont you know
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

Copperhead Road
Copperhead Road
Copperhead Road

Up any mountaincross any river
Through ang dangeryour love will deliver me
Everybody needs a reason for living
Thats what youve given me
Its a solemn oath I take
Nothin will stand in my way
You are the one Ive waited for
The love I need so desperately
Im standin here at heavens door
You are my destiny
For every question there is an answer
A destination only your heart can see
I just kept praying for love everlasting
Thats when you came to me
Its bigger then the two of us
Ill never give you up
You are the one Ive waited for
The love I need so desperately
Im standin here at heavens door
You are my destiny
Its a solemn oath I take
Nothin will stand in my way
You are the one Ive waited for
The love I need so desperately
Im standin here at heavens door
You are my destiny
You are the one Ive waited for
The love I need so desperately
Im standin here at heavens door
You are my destiny
Up any mountaincross any river
Through any dangeryour love will deliver me
As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see
Darling dont say a word Ive already heard
What your body is saying to mine
Youre tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
 Instrumental 
On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey were drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darling dont say a word Ive already heard
What your body is saying to mine
If you want all night you know its alright
Ive got time
Youve got a man with a slow hand
Youve got a lover with an easy touch
Youve got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
Youve got somebody
Who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand

Jai compris que personne pas mme lavocat ne me dfendait mieux

Des gens russ dans la rue des teubs dans la fac
Nouvelles baskets mais je saute les deux pieds dans la flaque

Donc jai pas prvu dplan B mais tu mas jamais vu trembler
Pourtant une vie peut schanger contre  E
Pendant que jlonge le vide viens pas mparler du danger
Vos dbats souffrent dune atroce strilit
Pour te duper cest les filles biens
Qules salopes ne cessent dimiter
Jsuis quun homme jaime les femmes  forte fertilit
Mais jprfre mon quipe que seule la mort devrait diviser
Et jprtends pas rsoudre les problmes du monde
Jveux juste tre honnte avec mes collgues
Ne jamais dconner pour le gros derche dune blonde
Jai une dent contre ce pays que les commerces surplombent

Ceux qui menvient deviennent ceux qui men veulent
Ceux qui men veulent deviennent ceux qui menvient
Plus je ten donne plus ten veux fils de pute
Jprends nimporte qui en feat
Ils se demandent tous si jai connu la misre
 lpoque de lcole personne nen tait la rise
Jtais endessous de la grande chelle parisienne
Des frres endetts en t se faisaient verbaliser
Il est plus facile de porter des pierres
Que le fardeau dun pch sur son dos
Le libre arbitre peut tapporter le pire
Le roi nest jamais en paix mme sur son trne

La zone est pleine denvieux jdois cacher mon bonheur
Le fric cest comme une femme  jen veux pas si jdois lcher mon honneur
Mes  pills de sangs capter  ou  dmes basans en balle

En cellule nos gardav ressemblent  des soires entre potes

Ma clique est l pour me baffer si jarrte
Donc je nplanifie pas dle faire
Un freestyle de nvrose et fils tas le flaire
Si tes conscient quon est deuspi dans ma clique
Les ngros du bloc me voit et me demandent de revenir dans la street
Cest comme dans le Far West  fusillades  visages dcouverts
Aucun bulletproof vest cest moi qules poulettes trouvent sexy
Nique ouais nique un exil au frais
Les keufs nous espionnent bien cachs dans leurs hlicoptres
Pendant qules bourges festoient je sais qumon hood reste froid
Ceux qui ny croyaient plus reoivent une touche despoir

Fascin par les voyous je voulais leur ressembler
Mais leurs curs taient secs et je le ressentais
Jessaye de rester un gosse
Ya que quand tes un gosse que tes heureux sans bl
Je me sens trs faible mauvais rejeton
Je fais un rejet quand les gens sans cur viennent se greffer
Ma mre elle pensait pas que jirais zoner
Que jlargirais mon rseau prenant des risques irraisonns
Des risques jen ai pris gars a partait en tape dbile
Jme suis retrouv  la brigade dpartementale des mineurs

Jai appris qula vie fait pas dcadeau

Nourri de merde mais je suis pas scato
Noye sous la paperasse jvois la daronne devenir paro
Les frres disparaissent et sans tour de passepasse
Mon quipe tpate ya pas qules noich qui vont faire un tabac
Seine zoo Saga on tabasse
Bien plus hard que Tabatha Cash
Tes comme cette gov sur Paname ngro tas pas ta place
Berc par le bruit des sirnes
La symphonie des balles rsonne dans ta ville
Les tympans percs comme la citerne
Assists par nos cits Vitry cest trop deuspi
Confrontant nos ides
On casse des ttes pour smontrer quon est ouverts desprit
Ouais imagine ma tte en poster dans la chambre de cflic

Yo de toute faon on va tous caner ouais ouais lami
Et quand on va cramer on dira tous Ouais cest lDiable qui nous la mise
Vision dcale le vice sinvite sans rien dclarer
Tu trouveras des camramans filmant des cams en camise
Jessaye de sauter le pas la vie me tire par les genoux
En vrai jai plus tendance  tre attir par mes jnouns
La femme et les ruses lhomme et les mots
Pour vous ils sont beaux mais ils sont tous faux de la nuque  lanus
Nique jai quelques vrais le reste qui sont ils 
Passent le salam le regard froid et puis se killent
Bref jvais l ou la vie mmne bref jpleure avec des fous rires
Jmne une vie de merde jraconte mes emmerdes avec le sourire
Jrefuse linvitation car lectrique est la chaise
La vie la mort jai lcul entre deux Pre Lachaise
Seulement nos actes diront si nous sommes valids

Daddy rolling through a fourway
Mama singing to a hymnal
Woodpaneled family car
My nose up against the window
Flashing neon beer sign
People all around
Mom said dont pay them no mind
That aint your kinda crowd

Needing saving
Latenight chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heartbreaking
Moneywasting
Hellraising
Crazy people

I found an old shoebox I wasnt supposed to find
Had written right on top Summer 
Saw Mama in a twopiece hanging off a lifeguard stand
Daddy right beside her with a cold one in his hand

Needing saving
Latenight chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heartbreaking
Moneywasting
Hellraising
Crazy people

Ive seen that look before
Here comes that doubt again
You think that girl we saw
Was more than just a friend
Yes there was a time
I thought she had it all
She meant the world to me
Back when the world was small
That was a river
This is the ocean
That never carried this much emotion
Nothing compares to
This deep devotion
That was a river
This is the ocean
The love we had before
Can never change this one
Were not imprisoned by
The past weve brought along
Its just you and me
One ship in the night
There are no boundaries
There is no end in sight
That was a river
This is the ocean
That never carried this much emotion
Nothing compares to
This deep devotion
That was a river
This is the ocean
Nothing compares to
This deep devotion
That was a river
This is the ocean

They say Love is more precious than gold
Cant be bought and it cant be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
Shes my treasure so very rare
She made me a millionaire

When we ride around ride around this old town
In my beatup car with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say That boy is sure livin in luxury
Sweet luxury

Cause love is more precious than gold
It cant be bought no never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire


When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Cause love is more precious than gold
It cant be bought and it cant be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
Hey momma how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress
Black mascara off a pillowcase
Cure a onetoomany headache
Momma can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next
And hey how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart

Can you ask Daddy if hes got time
To come and look at my front door
It got slammed last night
And now it dont close right
And just promise that you wont tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Momma please dont say
Im gonna laugh about this someday
You didnt see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart
Oh a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin so hard
Can you go blind from crying in the dark
Was it ever really real
If he dont feel like I feel

How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
How does he sleep at night
Momma the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma can you die from a broken heart
A broken heart
My Maria dont you know Ive come a long long way
I been longin to see her when shes around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
Im a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you

My Maria there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind
Gypsy lady youre a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
Ive been away
Havent seen you in a while
Howve you been
Have you changed your style
And do you think
That weve grown up differently
Dont seem the same
Seems youve lost your feel for me
So lets leave it alone
Cause we cant see eye to eye
There aint no good guy
There aint no bad guy
Theres only you and me
And we just disagree
Im goin back
To a place thats far away
How bout you
Have you got a place to stay
Why should I care
When Im just trying to get along
We were friends
Now its the end of our love song
So lets leave it alone
Cause we cant see eye to eye
There aint no good guy
There aint no bad guy
Theres only you and me
And we just disagree
So lets leave it alone
Cause we cant see eye to eye
There aint no good guy
There aint no bad guy
Theres only you and me
And we just disagree
So lets leave it alone
Cause we cant see eye to eye
There aint no good guy
There aint no bad guy
Theres only you and me
And we just disagree
When McVeigh on appeal in a Colorado prison read what I had written he wrote me a letter and 
From Newsweek March  
McVeigh also sent me a  piece he had written for Media Bypass He calls it Essay on Hypocrisy

Lets go
This mornin I got up at 
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree Ive seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
Its a beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my tshirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like Id lost my mind
I said Baby I love you cant live without you I know I dont say it enough

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Like you never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missing
Some days youre living
Ita beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you start singin
And you dont need a reason
Sometimes the worlds just right
Your clear eyes aint even blinkin
Got a heart full of grateful
For all youve been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Livin like youll never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missin
Some days youre living
Some days youre living
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a twolane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
Thats the truth

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin
Small town nights need both ends burnin
Shades need drawin hearts need fallin
Boots need knockin knockin boots
Knockin boots me and you oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need aslingin
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishin in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin
Small town nights need both ends burnin
Shades need drawin hearts need fallin
Boots need knockin knockin boots
Knockin boots girl me and you

Doors need shuttin
Lights need cuttin
Lips need lockin

He was working through college
On my grandpas farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah I was caught somewhere
Between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a wellbeaten path
Its funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste of

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since theyve seen a plow
Theres nothing time hasnt touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
Ive been missing so much
Yeah

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Strawberry wine oh
Strawberry wine
Appreciate your call
Means a lot and all
Yeah I got a minute
You and me can talk
About anything you want
As long as she aint in it

Say its been at least a month
Since Ive had any fun
Buddy Ill admit it
Yeah Im into going out
Think Im ready for a crowd
As long as she aint in it

Dont wanna hear her name
I dont wanna see her face I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

We could hit that place
Down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she aint in it

Dont wanna hear her name
I dont wanna see her face I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

I can drink and I can dance
I can party I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life wont be the same
As long as she aint in it
As long as she aint in it no
Shes been playing in a room on the strip for ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
Shes been readin about Nashville and all the records that everybodys buying
Says Im a simple girl myself grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
Shes gone country look at them boots
Shes gone country back to her roots
Shes gone country a new kind of suit
Shes gone country here she comes
Well the folk scenes dead but hes holding out in the Village
Hes been writing songs speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says I dont believe in money
But a man could make him a killin
Cause some of that stuff dont sound much different than Dylan
I hear down there its changed you see
Well theyre not as backward as they used to be
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
He commutes to LA but hes got a house in the Valley
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just aint on the rally
And he says honey Im a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This aint no place for children
Lord it sounds so easy this shouldnt take long
Be back in the money in no time at all
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
Yeah hes gone country a new kind of walk
Hes gone country a new kind of talk
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country oh back to his roots
Hes gone country
Hes gone country
Everybodys gone country
Yeah weve gone county
The whole worlds gone country
Songwriter  Bob McDill
Well I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
Theres something women like about a pickup man
When I turned sixteen I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said I never knew you were a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drivein show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause theres something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and youll know what I mean
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah theres something women like about a pickup man
It was seven hundred fence posts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was raining sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
There aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Its been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree you ought to see it now
Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
That if we dont see eye to eye theres something we can do

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
There aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Babe I love the way we work it out
Thats what love is all about

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle
Im a bad man
James Dean kinda Steve McQueen
Straight out the badlands
I rolled in and rained down
Like a storm cloud or a heat wave
Made you stay undercover where its safe
Dont give a damn about the plans you made
Were staying in the bed all day

Cause Im selfish
Restless like a river cant help it
Im taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause Im selfish
Yeah Im selfish Im selfish for you

Have you seen yourself in a fulllength mirror
Spinning around lately
Id lie cheat and steal
Feel the sweet scent overtake me
But the Lord sent an angel to save me
So he cant blame me
When my hands get a mind of their own
Girl if they get ahold of you I aint never letting go

Cause Im selfish
Restless like a river cant help it
Im taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause Im selfish
Yeah Im selfish Im selfish for you

Oh so selfish for you
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more

Cause Im selfish
Restless like a river cant help it
Im taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause Im selfish
Yeah Im selfish Im selfish for you

Still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
Im selfish for you
Whats that
I hear angels singin
Telling me to make my move
Listen to it
Their voices ringin baby
If you feel it get in the groove
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what youre feeling
I know what love is
Whats it to you
Times up
Trains a leavin baby
Are you ready to take that ride
Get on board
Dont keep my waiting baby
Say youre willin to cross that line
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what youre feeling
I know what love is
Whats it to you
Im sure your heart is telling you true
I gotta know what love is to you
Cause to me its the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what your feeling
I know what love is
Whats it to you
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what youre feeling
I know what love is
Whats it to you
I know what love is whats it to you
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
Im reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

Then Ill go on loving you
Ill go on loving you
Ill go on loving you

Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I dont know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
From the past
Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
Theyd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes
And way down south in the Everglades
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass sways
The eagles fly and the otters play
In the land of the Seminole

So blow blow Seminole wind
Blow like youre never gonna blow again
Im calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar

Progress came and took its toll
And in the name of flood control
They made their plans and they drained the land
Now the glades are going dry
And the last time I walked in the swamp
I sat upon a Cypress stump
I listened close and I heard the ghost
Of Osceola cry
Its been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it aint no thing
Just another day til Im on my way
To them cool cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how were working on the night shift baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk I know what you want
And what you like
Cause I do too yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how were working on the night shift baby

Yeah yeah
Its been a wreck me week
Oh but who needs sleep

When youre working on the night shift baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how were working on the night shift baby
Loving how were working on the night shift
Loving how were working on the night shift
Working on the night shift baby

Limsa jsuis n l dcembre
Cerveau OK mais coeur HS
Faut pas mpresser chante le feu la dtente
Comprends qule daron dit qujressemble  une gchette
Jviens des quartiers bresoms
Viens pas nous faire dleons
Trouvemoi post vers le fond
Chaudar car les  dmes frres le sont
Tout spasse comme prvu so Bourimech
On samuse avec des trucs tout pourris mme
On fsait des  contre  sur des terrains dfoot qui taient prvus pour  mecs
Toujours un ado ton grand corps te lrappelle
 du mat ya les renforts que tamne
Tas fait du mal et tu rgrettes  prsent
Mais   ans tcoutes bien plus Temps mort que ta mre
Limsa jsuis n l dcembre
Jsais pas quand jvais caner a mrend vraiment paro
De plus en plus de keufs sont derrire des barrires
De plus en plus de frres sont derrire des barreaux
Toi fais cque tas  faire
Jte calcule pas tes comme un riz sans sel
La mre de ma mre elle est presque parfaite
Car elle ma tout appris gros sauf  vivre sans elle
Aller baiss que jmarche dans un quartier ou dans les alles aises
Capuche casquette comme si jallais diser
Quand jrangeais ma chambre cest qujsavais qujallais baiser
Les meufs jaimais pas les blesser
Un Dom Juan affil car jtais vla lfilou
Et quand une beurette me crame avec une autre beurette
Jlui fais croire qucest ma zinecou


Tous les jours jpense  la mort depuis que jsuis petit
Comme  Fort Alamo en plus subtil
Jdonnerai mon corps  la science mme si jpue lshit
Et si jpuis te dire fuck rest in peace
Car jnourris mes dmons dans le rehausseur
Jles ai vu faire des pompes prendre des forces
Attention cest ltal ton quipe a la trouille sent lodeur du mthane
Jai les fringues uses par tous mes gus qui les portent qui les gardent et ngocient
Marcel et sauteries
On est pas venu lerpar mais pour aligner les plantes
Parce quil est tard Nigel est bien dans ses baskets
 force pour creuser lcart
On est parmi les pas nets
Crari les barges

When I was fourteen I was fallin fast
For a blueeyed girl in my homeroom class
Tryin to find the courage to ask her out
Was like tryin to get oil from a water spout
What she wouldve said I cant say
I never did ask then she moved away
I learned something from my blueeyed girl
Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
The longer I live the more I believe
You do have to give if you wanna receive
Theres a time to listen a time to talk
And you might have to crawl even after you walk
Had sure things blow up in my face
Seen the longshot win the race
Been knocked down by the slammin door
Picked myself up and came back for more
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance
Lifes a dance
Lifes a dance
Take a chance on love
Lifes a dance
You learn as you go
Who knows
I might wind up on the cover of a Rolling Stone
With a pair of shades and a Grammy in my hand
Just a blue jean boy in a great big world of yes
I got my speech already in my head
Then Ill say then Ill say yeah Ill say

Thank you uncle Dean for teaching me La Bamba on guitar
Thank you girl from Broken Bow who shot an arrow through my heart
Thank you mama for the roll and
Thank you daddy for the rock
Most of all most of all
Thanks to the bulls that bucked me off woo

Aw hell what if
I turn the rhymes up in my mind into a hit
Then it played a hundred times a day on the radio
Then it gave a little broken heart somewhere some hope
And Id jump up on the stage and the chorus would go
Da da da da da da da da da

Thank you uncle Dean for teaching me La Bamba on guitar
Thank you girl from Broken Bow who shot an arrow through my heart
Thank you mama for the roll and
Thank you daddy for the rock
Most of all most of all
Thanks to the bulls that bucked me off yeah

Every knock down in the dirt
Every no I ever heard
Sure feel good to laugh when I look back and flip the bull the bird
Every nail that ripped my shirt
Every no I ever heard
Sure feel good to laugh when I look back and flip the bull the bird
Then Ill say then Ill say then Ill say

Thank you uncle Dean for teaching La Bamba on guitar
Thank you girl from Broken Bow who shot an arrow through my heart
Thank you Lynchburg for the nights I needed edges took away
Thank you vinyl for the soundtrack to my life its sure been great
Thank you mama for the roll and
Thank you daddy for the rock
Most of all most of all
Thanks to the bulls that bucked me off
Yeah most of all
Thank you each and every bull that bucked me off

And I say and I say and I say
I got rice cookin in the microwave
Got a three day beard I dont plan to shave
And its a goofy thing but I just gotta say hey
Im doin alright

Yeah I think Ill make me some homemade soup
Im feelin pretty good and thats the truth
Its neither drink nor drug induced no
Im just doin alright

And its a great day to be alive
I know the suns still shining
When I close my eyes
Theres some hard times in the neighborhood
But why cant every day be just this good

Its been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed Id sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope theyre doin alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess hes doing alright

And its a great day to be alive
I know the suns still shining
When I close my eyes
Theres some hard times in the neighborhood
But why cant every day be just this good

Sometimes its lonely sometimes its only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes Im falling desperately calling
Howlin at the moon ahooh


Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

And its a great day to be alive
I know the suns still shining
When I close my eyes
Theres some hard times in the neighborhood
But why cant every day be just this good

And its a great day to be alive
I know the suns still shining
When I close my eyes
Theres some hard times in the neighborhood
But why cant every day be just this good
Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
Id really ever take it this far
Singing in the bars

And chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowds into it lord
It makes this thing Im doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

And chasing that neon rainbow
Ima living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Now daddys got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said son I just know
Were going to hear you singing on it some day
I made it up to Music Row
Lordy dont the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldnt trade a minute
I wouldnt have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

And chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Beer dont keep
Loves not cheap
And trucks dont wreck themselves
Mama aint a shrink
Daddy aint a bank
And God aint a wishin well
Money aint rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it

Girls like to laugh
Tears dont last
And scareds what prayings for
If its close swing the bat
Everybodys gotta past
And loves worth living for
When you dance hold her close
Til it breaks go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No you dont get to do some things again

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it

When you cant take it slow
Cause time sure wont
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her til your glass runs out of sand

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe cant use
I know I dont probably know what I think I do
But theres something to some of it
Some of it
This is what a woman wants

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when Im ugly he still better love me
And I can be late for a datethats fine
But hed better be on time
Any man of minell say it fits just right

Come on everybody on the floor
Aone two athree four
Hup two hup
If you wanna be a man of mine thats right
This is what a woman wants
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well theres a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey women music and smoke
Its where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin boogie
Ive got a good job I work hard for my money
When its quittin time I hit the door runnin
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin down that highway to that hideaway
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin boogie

Yeah heel toe dosido come on baby lets go boot scootin
Cadillac blackjack baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Oh get down turn around go to town boot scootin boogie

The bartender asks me says son whatll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin at me
The dance floors hoppin and its hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws inlaws crooks  straights all out makin it shake
Doin the boot scootin boogie

Yeah heel toe dosido come on baby lets go boot scootin
Cadillac blackjack baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Oh get down turn around go to town boot scootin boogie
Someone keeps callin
You pick it up and youre talkin real low
I watch the rain fallin
Just like Im watchin you go
Why you have to sound so happy baby
Why cant I feel nothin at all
When you hung the moon
In a big empty sky
An said you would love me
And Id never cry
But Ive cried so much
Now the moons turning blue
Baby
Tell me what else can I do
And the shadows grow longer
Im watching this house burning down
I want to be stronger
But all this heartaches just wearing me down
An I remember we were happy
An all our days baby they found their time
Cause you hung the moon
In that big empty sky
An said you would love me
And Id never cry
But Ive cried so much
Now the moons turning blue
Baby
Tell me what else can I do
Cause you hung the moon
In that big empty sky
An said you would love me
And Id never cry
Honey Ive cried so much
Now the moons turning blue
Baby
Tell me what else can I do
Baby
Tell me what else can I do
She turned up her nose as she walked by my Cadillac
From the corner of my eye I saw you and you laughed
You were sitting on the swing on your front porch
Apainting your nails like you were bored
And you yelled she was sure impressed with you

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

I yelled and asked if you would like a ride
When we pulled out of your yard I bald a tire
You was laughing at me I was doing James Dean
You was the prettiest girl Ive ever seen
When you rolled your eyes and twirled my pink fur dice

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

Well good ol boys dont get no breaks
And the rich boys think they got what it takes
But theres someone for each of us they say

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

I said some girls do
You know some girls do
Like boys like me
You know some girls do
Ive seen a lot of places
Ive been around the world
Ive seen some pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls
After all Ive witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle you have to see to believe

Cause God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven brother heres your chance
Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
First He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest then on the very next day

Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin trouble
Half your life makin it right
One day Im the exception
Most days Im just like most
Some days Im headed in the right direction
And some days I aint even close

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just dont run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still dont get it right sometimes
I just dont get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah but now I dont stay near as long

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn burn burning man
Just a burning man
Woo

Maybe Ill go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

Im a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin stone
Im a little bit heaven but still a little bit fleshandbone
Little found little dontknowwhereIam
Im a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn burn burning man
Just a burning man

Burning man
Lazy yellow moon comin up tonite
Shinin thru the trees
Crickets are singin and lightning bugs
Are floatin on the breeze
Baby get ready
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stone road
Im gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get readyOooooooOooo
You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
Well be fallin in love in the middle of the night
Just movin slow
Stayin the whole night thru feels so good to be with you
Spring is almost over and the summers comin
The days are gettin long
Waited all winter for the time to be right just to take you along
Baby get ready
And it dont matter if we sit forever and the fish dont bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get readyOoooooooOoo

You and me going fishin in the dark
Dont rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
My heart aint ready
For the Rolling Stones
I dont feel like rocking
Since my babys gone
So dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
Ive been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request


I aint got nothing
Against rock and roll
But when your hearts been broken
You need a song thats slow
Aint nothing like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

Dont rock the jukebox
I want to hear George Jones
My heart aint ready
For the Rolling Stones
I dont feel like rocking
Since my babys gone
So dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Yeah dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
You were the first thing that I thought of
When I thought I drank you off my mind
When I get lost in the liquor
Youre the only one I find
And if I did the things I oughta
You still would not be mine
So Ill keep a tight grip on the bottle
Gettin loose and killin time
This killin time is killin me
Drinking myself blind thinkin I wont see
That if I cross that line and they bury me
I just might find Ill be killin time for eternity
I dont know nothin bout tomorrow
Ive been lost in yesterday
Ive spent all my life just dying For a love that passed away
And if theres an end to all my sorrow
And this is the only price Ill pay Ill be a happy man when I go
And I cant wait another day
Repeat chorus
Baby since you left me theres somebody new
She thinks Im perfect I swear
She likes my body my class and my charm
She says Ive got a confident air
She respects my ambition thinks Im talented too
But shes in love with an image time is bound to see through

OhBut you know me better than that
You know the me that gets lazy and fat
How moody I can be all my insecurities
Youve seen me lose all my charm you know I was raised on a farm
Oh she tells her friends Im perfect
And that I love her cat but you know me better than that

I miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
Now its ballet and symphony hall
Im into culture clean up to my ears
Its like wearing a shoe thats too small
Oh I caught her with an issue of Brides magazine
Staring at dresses and picking out rings


Oh she tells her friends Im perfect and that I love that cat
Oh but you know me better than that
Midnight and Im awaiting on the twelveohfive
Hoping itll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight youre just a heartache in disguise
So wont you keep my heart from breaking
If its only for a very short time
Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it aint really smart
The joker aint the only fool
Wholl do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking bout a life of crime
Cause thats what Ill have to do
To keep me away from you
Honey you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby I know it makes you sad
But when theyre handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some
Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it aint really smart
The joker aint the only fool
Wholl do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking bout a life of crime
Cause thats what Ill have to do
To keep me away from you
Lovers I know youve had a few
So hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell em theyre the only one
And others they know just what Im going through
And its ahard to be a lover
When you say youre only in it for fun
Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it aint really smart
The joker aint the only fool
Wholl do anything for you
Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it aint really smart
The joker aint the only fool
Wholl do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking bout a life of crime
Cause thats what Ill have to do
To keep me away from you
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
Theres a rundown bar cross the railroad tracks
Ive got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smokefilled room
No telling how many tears Ive sat here and cried
Or how many lies that Ive lied
Telling my poor heart shell come back someday

Oh but Ill be alright
As long as theres light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
This hurt inside of me aint never gonna end

Oh but Ill be alright
As long as theres light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Lights go down wheels go round
Im taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
Im not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot
Slow dance in a parking lot

A half song gone one door open across the lot
A rentacops rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to Shes Every Woman
And I dont care what song comes next
Im falling right here dont want a safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot

And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got even if its just

A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot
Amarillo by morning up from San Antone
Everything that Ive got is just what Ive got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
Ill be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning Amarillo Ill be there

They took my saddle in Houston broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well Ill be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge aint blind
Amarillo by morning Amarillos on my mind

Amarillo by morning up from San Antone
Everything that Ive got is just what Ive got on
I aint got a dime but what I got is mine
I aint rich but Lord Im free
Amarillo by morning Amarillos where Ill be
Amarillo by morning Amarillos where Ill be
Sister smoked all the Camels in the County Last week
She cleaned out the  sneaking in smelling like nocotine
Mommas burning chicken for the Tupperware party tonight
Daddys asleep in his chair the TVs blaring the stats for Halftime

Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car

Well its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
Itll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look

Well its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Hehyeee

You know you got a job and a little bitty cheque
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
Its all part of a little bitty scheme

Its alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Same old dive same old end of the work week drink
Bartender knows my name but I dont mind
She kicks em up strong serves me up right

And here I go again Im drinkin one Im drinkin two
I got my heartache medication a strong dedication
To gettin over you turnin me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication well it suits me fine
And Im drinkin enough to take you off my mind

Another girl another dance to a country song
Turnin me on heres to a good time
And halfway to feelin alright

And here I go again Im drinkin one Im drinkin two

Teardrops turnin into bubbles

Heartache medication takin me away
Oh whoa
I brought flowers to your door last night
I done wrong and I wanna make it right
You say Im not welcome here
I know it oughta be perfectly clear
But I cant help but wonder what it might be like

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Oh I must have been a fool back then
To lose something that you cant have again
Ive done all that I know to do
Second guessed my every move
But I cant help but wonder how it might have been

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Baby could you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
You see that mountain over there Yeah
Well one of these days Im going to climb that mountain

Oh play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then Ill float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle daze dreaming again


Swim across the river just to prove that Im a man
Spend the day being lazy just being natures friend
Climb a long tall hickory Bend it over skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks using sawmill slabs for bats

Play some backhome comeon music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because thats where music has to start


Oh play me mountain music
Spent fortyeight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
Shes got me sayin sugarpie honey darlin and dear
I aint seen the Braves play a game all year
Im gonna get fired if I dont get some sleep
My long lost buddies say Im gettin in too deep

But I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in til that girl got a hold of me
Now Im holdin umbrellas and openin up doors
Im takin out the trash and Im sweepin my floors
Im crossin my fingers and countin every kiss
Prayin that it keeps goin on like this

Cause I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa shell move a little closer
She cant get enough of me

Yeah I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

Come on baby
You know what I like
Yeah I like that
Mmm mmm mmm
Hey dont forget to turn out the lights
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen go climb a tree get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what youve got
Even if it dont add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But Id still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breaths a gift the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Aint nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world aint half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
Settle down with just what they need
Livin on love
She dont care bout whats in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin on love

Livin on love buyin on time
Without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin on love
It sounds simple thats what youre thinkin
But love can walk through fire without blinkin
It doesnt take much when you get enough
Livin on love

Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
Livin on love
He cant see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand theyll walk through that door
Just livin on love

Livin on love buyin on time
Without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin on love
It sounds simple thats what youre thinkin
But love can walk through fire without blinkin
It doesnt take much when you get enough
Livin on love

No it doesnt take much when you get enough
Livin on love
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy aint doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just cant seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song

Finally saved some money up
Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didnt have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I cant seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song
But I love my life
Man its something to see
Its the kids and the dogs and you and me
Its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
Its the sound of a slow simple song
Now when I was a young girl
My dad warned me about the opposite sex
Hed say yeah thats just what you need
Some crazy boy with wild ideas
You know what always happens next
I tried to heed his advice
Now Im thinkin it sounds kinda nice

Its just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark someone I cant resist
A little rendezvous a little mystery
When I look at you I think thats just what I need

Now my momma told me in this dogeatdog world
You gotta work harder than a man
Shed say yeah thats just what you need
Some romance book Romeo callin you at work and messin up your plans
Night falls I slow down
I start dreamin of you comin around

Its just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark someone I cant resist
A little rendezvous a little mystery
When I look at you I think thats just what I need

Moonlight sweet bliss
Melting with every kiss
Dancin real slow
When you hold me close I know

Its just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark someone I cant resist
A little rendezvous a little mystery
When I look at you I think thats just what I need
Just what I need
Just what I need
Oh yeah
Verse 
Rip the calendar page out for May
The days gettin longer
Into the sun outta the shade
Pretty girls by the water
The DJ dont spin slow songs
Cause everybody wants to dance
Everything you love about the summer
Just brings your memory back
To when it was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Verse 
Every sunset smile and midnight kiss
Yeah I still remember
Im still burnin backroads in my head
Every June to September
Oh yeah it doesnt get any better
When it was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Bridge
It was
All you
All me
All night
All summer long
It was
Chorus
July magic it was bare feet
The radio cranked with the doors off the Jeep
Bulls Farm on the hood with the stars out
Livin large in a small town
I was all in you were all mine
The hot teens
Wish I could freeze time
I may never recover from when it was
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer
Outtro
All you all night all summer summer
All you all night all summer summer

I saw the light
Ive been baptised
By the fire in your touch
And the flame in your eyes
Im born to love again
Im a brand new man

Well the whole towns talking
About the line Im walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone
I used to have a wild side
They say a countrymilewide
Id burn those beer joints down
Thats all changed now
You turned my life around


I used to love them and leave them
Id brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything Ive ever known
Were right on track
I aint looking back


Im born to love again
Im a brand new man
Brother jukebox sister wine
Mother freedom father of time
Since she left me by myself
Youre the only family Ive got left

I go down to that same old caf
Where I try to wash my troubles away
Im still down and Im still all alone
But it beats staying home all night long

Brother jukebox sister wine
Mother freedom father of time
Since she left me by myself
Youre the only family Ive got left

I go home and I climb that old stairway
And I tell myself tomorrows a new day
But I know Ill just go out again
And spend my time with my new nextofkin

Brother jukebox sister wine
Mother freedom father of time
Since she left me by myself
Youre the only family Ive got left

Brother jukebox sister wine
Mother freedom father of time
Since she left me by myself
Youre the only family Ive got left

Youre the only family Ive got left
Shes dressed to kill in a dress he bought her
She wouldnt care if he walked in and caught her
Shes come to dance a dance or two
And do no tellin what by the time the night is through
She found out the hard way about him
Shes out to find out how shell do without him
Her hands are shakin her hearts pounding
By the way shes drinking his memorys drowin
Shes not the cheatin kind
Shes been cheated one too many times
Oh shes never fooled around
Cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
Shes not foolin now
She walks by and every head turns
You can see how hot her fire burns
He didnt know what a good thing he had
Its too late and thats too bad
Shes not the cheatin kind
Shes been cheated one too many times
Oh shes never fooled around
Cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
Shes not foolin now
Shes not the cheatin kind
Shes been cheated one too many times
Oh shes never fooled around
Cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
Shes not foolin now
Shes not the cheatin kind
Shes been cheated one too many times
Oh shes never fooled around
Cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
Shes not foolin now
verse one
Shes been going out with him
Shes been going out with me
Said shed let us know by tonight which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house and sure enough
Chorus
That aint my truck in her drive
Man this aint my day tonight
Looks like shes in love and Im out of luck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl my whole world
But that aint my truck
verse two
I pulled over by the curb
Ive been sitting here all night
Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right
I thought of breaking down the door
But theres nothing left to say
That Chevy x says it all
Sitting in my place
Chorus
That aint my truck in her drive
Man this aint my day tonight
Looks like shes in love and Im out of luck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
Thats my girlmy whole worldrepeat to fade
Some times she runs some times she dont
More than once shes left me on the side of the road
The older she gets the slower we go
But There Aint Nothin Wrong With The Radio
She needs a carburetor a set of plug wires
Shes riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers dont work and the horn dont blow
But There Aint Nothin Wrong With The Radio
I got sixteen speakers crossin my back dash
A little bobbin dog watchin everybody pass
Dual antennas whippin in the wind
Lord there aint no country station that I cant tune in
She aint a Cadillac and she aint a Rolls
But There Aint Nothin Wrong With The Radio
I got stopped by a cop late last night out of date tags and no taillights
He said I oughta run you in but im a lettin you go
Because There Aint Nothin Wrong With The Radio
Got the best lookin gal in my hometown
I asked her last time that I took her out
Honey tell me what it is that makes you love me so
She said There Aint Nothin Wrong With your Radio
No she aint a Cadillac and she aint a rolls
But There Aint Nothin Wrong With The Radio
Johnnys daddy was takin him fishin
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin a fishin pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said We cant leave her behind
Son I know you dont want her to go
But someday youll change your mind

And Johnny said

Take Jimmy Johnson take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she dont go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please dont take the girl

Same old boy same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said If you do what I tell you to there
Wont be any harm

And Johnny said

Take my money take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Heres the watch that my grandpa gave me
Heres the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please dont take the girl

Same old boy same sweet girl
Five years down the road
Theres gonna be a little one and she
Says Its time to go
Doctor says The babys fine
But youll have to leave
Cause his mommas fadin fast and
Johnny hit his knees

And then he prayed

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
Ill gladly take her place if youll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please dont take the girl

Johnnys daddy
Was takin him fishin
When he was eight years old
I was just standing
Alone in this room
Surrounded by memories
We stopped making too soon
Oh I was just standing
I was just standing
Alone in this room
Alone in this room
And I was just thinking
All to myself
How I still want you
And nobody else
Oh I was just thinking
I was just thinking
All to myself
Oh all to myself
In this darkness I move slowly
Always struggling to be free
But I still hear your voice
Everywhere I see the choice
Thats made such a fool of me yeah
I was just wondering
There was a way
To bring you back to me
Maybe things I could say
Oh I was just wondering
I was just wondering
If there was a way
Going out of my mind these days
Like Im walking round in a haze
I cant think straight I cant concentrate
And I need a shave

I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says Son youre gonna get fired
This aint your style and from behind my coffee cup
I just smile

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess Im in
Spending all my time with you
Theres nothing else Id rather do
What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough
Cant stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful what a beautiful mess Im in
Ahhh

This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Im losing my mind I swear it might be the death of me
But I dont care

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess Im in
Spending all my time with you
Theres nothing else Id rather do
What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough
Cant stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful what a beautiful mess Im in
Ahhh

Is it your eyes is it your smile
All I know is that youre driving me wild

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess Im in
Spending all my time with you
Theres nothing else Id rather do
What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough
Cant stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful
What a beautiful

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess Im in
Spending all my time with you
Theres nothing else Id rather do
What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough
Cant stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful what a beautiful mess Im in
Ahhh
Ahhh
I never ask you where you are going
I never ask you where you have been
I have never called and checked your story
When you stayed out with all your friends
I have never tried to catch you lying
I did not want to know the truth
I would rather go on loving blind girl
Than go on loving without you

I wish I did not know now what I did not know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I am not saying it is you
You could never be true
I just do not want to know how it ends
You would still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I would still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then

I have always said what I do not know
Could not hurt as bad as leaving you
Turns out I knew what I was thinking
It is not an easy thing to do
Well I guess I should be going
I sure found out too much to stay
Please do not say you are sorry
I might wait another day


You would still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I would still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then
Yeah I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then
Been trying so hard just to talk to you
Havent heard half of what you want me to
I hurt so bad over where weve been
Dont know how not to go back there again
I know what I want to say
Can I get it through to you now
In some other way
Like there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman this woman and this man
A strangers eyes in a lovers face
See no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door
I feel the need to reach out to you even more
Its a circle were going round
If we dont get us out from under its going to take us down
See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman this woman and this man
For all weve got to lose so much to gain
If we come this far and leave it behind
Theres only you and me to blame
See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How can they be so in love and still never see
How they can get it back again
This woman this woman and this man
Yeah we can get it back again
This woman this woman and this man
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
When the moon is bright
On a Saturday night
Theres a thousand stars in the sky
On a winding road her memory flows
Shell face the fact
She wants to go back
She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
Shell say Every once in a while
Every once in a while
She tries to forget
But she hasnt yet
Not a single day goes by
That feeling again reminds of when
I held her tight it felt so right
She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
Shell say Every once in a while
Every once in a while
And every once in a while
She calls my name out loud
And when she thinks about us
Shell face the fact
She wants to go back
She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
Shell say Every once in a while
Every once in a while
Every once in a while
Every once in a while
I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day theres always light and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it fallin in the night and fillin up my mind
All the heavens rivers come to light I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just cant believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always calling for you Im fallin for you now
Just like the rain
When the cloud is rollin over thunders strikin me
Its as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldnt see
That its always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess Ive known all along I just belong here with you fallin
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you Im fallin for you now
Just like the rain
And when the night falls on our better days and were lookin to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that well find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin forever well be fallin
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Its another backdoorsneakingin
Whereyoubeen midnight
Quiet as a Mack truck lotsa luck
Thinking up an alibi

But every light in the house is on
Everything is gone

She left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red goodbye in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation no reconciliation
No letstalkitover number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye

Couldve thrown a knockdown
Scream and shout haveitout tirade
She couldve made it real tough bringing up
All the hell that I raised

But no more wasted words on me
No she kept it short and sweet

She left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red goodbye in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation no reconciliation
No letstalkitover number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye goodbye

But no more wasted words on me
No she kept it short and sweet

She left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red goodbye in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation no reconciliation
No letstalkitover number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
Goodbye says it all

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought hed stop
At Webs and have him a drink fore he went home to her
Andy WoLo said hello
He said Hi whats new
And Wo said Sit down I got some bad news thats going to hurt

Said Im your best friend and you know thats right
But your young bride isnt home tonight
Since youve been gone shes been seeing that Amos boy Seth
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said Boy dont you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth Ive been with her myself

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Andy got scared and left the bar
Andy didnt have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

He went off to Andys house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
Whyd you do it

The judge said guilty on a makebelieve trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said suppers waiting at home and I got to get to it

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Well they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andys house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
Thats one body thatll never be found
You see little sister doesnt miss when she aims her gun

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands
Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Oh girl wash your face before you come to the table
Girl know your place be willing and able

Girl shoulders back and stand up straight
Girl watch your mouth and watch your weight
Mind your manners smile for the camera

And we say grace and we say Maam
If you aint into that we dont give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name just hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And Id send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For  dollars my friend lost his life
Id love to spit some BeechNut in that dudes eyes and shoot him with my old

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasnt ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didnt go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight

A No trespass sign and time to kill
Nobodys gonna get hurt so whats the big deal
Theres somethin bout a truck in a farmers field

And theres somethin bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
Theres somethin bout beer sittin on ice

And theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmers field Hah will make a boy a mess
Theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress

And theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
The most natural thing youve ever felt before
Theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more

And theres somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck

Theres somethin bout a creek around  AM
After a few of those beers you wanna dive on in
You dont need no clothes so just hang em on a limb
Theres somethin bout a creek around  AM

And theres somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
Aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
Hah
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin there on that lawn
Discount shades store bought tan
Flip flops and cutoff jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
Im on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And were were just getting started
I was singin to you you were singin to me
I was so alive never been more free
Fired up my daddys lighter and we sang
Ooohh
Stayed there til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin dont go
When I think about you I think about 
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldnt even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet thered still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didnt care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though youre a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me do you think about 
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woah Springsteen
Woahohohoh
Well she seemed all right by dawns early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasnt drinkin again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin end
Some folks whispered some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away let the guilty pay its Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I aint sayin its right or its wrong
But maybe its the only way
Talk about your revolution
Its Independence Day

Let freedom ring let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away let the guilty pay its Independence Day

Roll the stone away
Its Independence Day
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me
In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

Your dance your drive You make me feel alive
The way you talk the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
Clear creeks and cool mountain mornings
Honest work out in the field
Corn bread in my mamas kitchen
Daddy saying grace before the meal
Family ties run deep in this land
And Im never very far from what I am
I was born country and thats what Ill always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood
I was born country and this countrys what I love
Moonlight and you here beside me
Crickets serenading in the yard
What more could two people ask for
Laying here in love beneath the stars
Now this is where I wanna raise my kids
Just the way my mom and daddy did
I was born country and thats what Ill always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood
I was born country and this countrys what I love
I was born country and thats what Ill always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood
I was born country and this countrys what I love
I was born country

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh it sounds good to me I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh it sounds good to me
Yes it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh it sounds good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you
They said change your clothes
She said No I wont
They said comb your hair
She said some kids dont
And her parents dreams went up in smoke
They said you cant leave
She said Yes I will
They said dont see him
She said his name is Bill
Shes on a roll and its all uphill

Shes a wild one
With an angels face
Shes a womanchild
In a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddys knee
He said You can be anything you wanna be
Shes a wild one
Running free

She loves Rock and Roll
They said its Satans tongue
She thinks theyre too old
They think shes too young
And the battle lines are clearly drawn

Shes a wild one
With an angels face
Shes a womanchild
In a state of grace
When she was three years old in her daddys knee
He said You can be anything you wanna be
Shes a wild one
Running free

She has future plans
And dreams at night
When they tell her life is hard
She says thats alright
Yeah

Shes a wild one
With an angels face
Shes a womanchild
In a state of grace
When she was three years old in her daddys knee
He said You can be anything you wanna be
Shes a wild one
With an angels face
Shes a womanchild
In a state of grace
When she was three years old in her daddys knee
He said You can be anything you wanna be
Shes a wild one
Running free
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love Id known
But you rescued me from reachin for the bottom
And brought me back from bein too far gone

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Ive looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottles always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didnt waste it
Cause theres nothing like your love to get me high

And youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time


Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

A Little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But hes got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well I asked him while he shined my shoes
Howd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
Itll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Well I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said youre a mighty little boy to bea working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Baby what do you say we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
Ive got people in Boston aint your Daddy still in Des Moines
We can pack up tomorrow tonight lets flip a coin

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a UHaul van
Couple of modern day Moses searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then well take a look at the map

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

Were gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy were bound to outrun
The bad luck thats been tailing us

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California
Ohh California Carolina California
I know you loved him a long time ago
Even now in my arms you still want him I know
But darling this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight dont close your eyes

Dont close your eyes let it be me
Dont pretend its him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And youll find more love than youve ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
Dont close your eyes

Maybe Ive been a fool holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms knowing hes in your mind
But I keep hoping some day that youll see the light
Let it be me tonight dont close your eyes

Dont close your eyes let it be me
Dont pretend its him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And youll find more love than youve ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And dont close your eyes

Dont close your eyes let it be me
Dont pretend its him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And youll find more love than youve ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And dont close your eyes

Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And dont close your eyes
I read a note my grandma wrote back in 
Grandpa kept it in his coat and he showed it once to me
He said Boy you might not understand but a long long time ago
Grandmas daddy didnt like me none but I loved your Grandma so

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter and this is what it said

If you get there before I do dont give up on me
Ill meet you when my chores are through
I dont know how long Ill be
But Im not gonna let you down darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again
Ill be loving you Love me

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray
I know Id never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her his eyes filled up with tears

If you get there before I do dont give up on me
Ill meet you when my chores are through
I dont know how long Ill be
But Im not gonna let you down darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again
Ill be loving you Love me
Between now and then till I see you again
Ill be loving you Love me
If you aint got two kids by 
Youre probably gonna die alone
At least thats what tradition told you
And it dont matter if you dont believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row like youre sposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer different park

Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddys hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round

We think the first times good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we wont end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Aint what you want its what you know
Just happy in the shoes youre wearin
Same checks were always cashin
To buy a little more distraction

Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddys hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round
Mary Mary quite contrary
Were so bored until were buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go round
And round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it aint slowin down
This merry go round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just dont give a damn no more
I been thinkin about our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
Ive reached the only logical conclusion
Love aint supposed to make sense

This aint no thinkin thing right brain left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
Its a chemical physical emotional devotion
Passion that we cant hold back
Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing

Forget mathematical equations
Selfhelp psychology
Gray matter dont matter much darlin
When its gettin down to you and me oh

This aint no thinkin thing right brain left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
Its a chemical physical emotional devotion
Passion that we cant hold back
Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing

Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing girl no
No this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing
Aint no thinkin thing girl
This aint no thinkin thing baby
This aint this aint this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing
Well I know I disappeared a time or two
And along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
Selling VCRs in Arkansas at a WalMart
I havent had a drink in nineteen days
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night
I think Im on a roll here in Little Rock
Im solid as a stone baby wait and see
Ive got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you baby Im not me
I dont know why I held it all inside
You mustve thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
That Jesus would forgive but a daddy dont forget
I think Im on a roll here in Little Rock
Im solid as a stone baby wait and see
Ive got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you baby Im not me
Lying here upon this motel bed
My thoughts of you explode inside my head
Like a castle built upon the sand
I let love crumble in my hand
I think Im on a roll here in Little Rock
Im solid as a stone baby wait and see
Ive got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you baby Im not me
Without you baby Im not me
I think Im on a roll here in Little Rock
We didnt know that times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didnt seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Choppin cotton and pushin plows
And learnin how to give it all we had
As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddys eyes
And felt the love in mamas hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin back I understand
Chorus
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced
When Sunday mornings rolled around
We dressed up in handme downs
Just in time to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long its been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldnt work
Chorus
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced
Walkin in high cotton
Ive been a rock and Ive got my fences I never let them down
When it comes to love I keep my senses I dont get kicked around
I shivered once you broke into my soul the damage is done now
Im out of control how did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

You can make me want you anytime you want to youre burning me alive
I cant deny you even when I catch you weaving a weak alibi
Cause when the night falls you make me forget your love is killing me
And it aint over yet how did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you


I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now
Im out of control
How did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like no one like you
No one like you
When I first saw you I saw love
And the first time you touched me I felt love
And after all this time
Youre still the one I love

Mmm yeah
Looks like we made it
Look how far weve come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew wed get there someday

They said I bet theyll never make it
But just look at us holding on
Were still together still going strong

Youre still the one
Youre still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Youre still the one I want for life
Youre still the one
Youre still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Youre still the one I kiss goodnight

Aint nothing better
We beat the odds together
Im glad we didnt listen
Look at what we would be missing

They said I bet theyll never make it
But just look at us holding on
Were still together still going strong

Youre still the one
Youre still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Youre still the one I want for life
Youre still the one
Youre still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Youre still the one I kiss goodnight
Youre still the one
Yeah youre still the one
Youre still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Youre still the one I want for life
Ooh youre still the one
Youre still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Youre still the one I kiss goodnight

Im so glad we made it
Look how far weve come my baby
Dancin in the dark
Middle of the night
Takin your heart
And holdin it tight
Emotional touch
Touchin my skin
And askin you to do
What youve been doin all over again

Oh its a beautiful thing
Dont think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that wont let me go

Its your love
It just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I cant get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell Im under
Its your love

Better than I was
More than I am
And all of this happened
By takin your hand
And who I am now
Is who I wanted to be
And now that were together
Im stronger than ever
Im happy and free

Oh its a beautiful thing
Dont think I can keep it all in no
And if you asked me why I changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

Its your love
It just does somethin to me
It sends a shock right through me
I cant get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell Im under
Its your love
Oh baby

Oh its a beautiful thing
Dont think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that wont let me go

Its your love
It just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I cant get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell Im under
Its your love

Its your love
Its your love
I laid a red rose on your front porch
And wrote I love you on a note
I rang the doorbell and turned to go
Baby when the curtains moved I couldnt believe the view
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
So take your cheatin hands off my red dress
Cause I aint wearin this thing for you
I see you clearly now and your lies too
They say that love is blind baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
Why baby why should I listen to you
I cry baby cry now Im walkin out the door
They say that love is blind baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I probably shouldnt have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I shouldve left it alone
When I caught you looking

A little smile a little how you been
A little touch a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

But after a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh after a few

We always take it way too far
Where its too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that well be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
Cause it happens every time

After a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah after a few

Little smile little how you been
Little touch little reminisce
We both know how it ends

After a few drinks
Its always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye given up at two
If we didnt wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh after a few
Mama told her baby
girl take it real slow
Girl told her mama
hey I really gotta go
hes waitin in the car
Mama said
girl you wont get far
This is the story of an average jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lovers lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh if she could have only seen
But fates got plans that it dont wanna show cause  
That boys just a walkaway joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
Hes the wrong kind of paradise
Shes gonna know it in a matter of time
That boys just a walkaway joe
Just a little while into abilene
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean
Shes waitin in the car
Underneath the texaco star
She only wanted love
Never bargained for this
She cant help but love him for the way he is
Shes only seventeen
And there aint no reasoning
So shell ride this ride
As far as it will go but  
That boys just a walkaway joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
Hes the wrong kind of paradise
Shes gonna know it in a matter of time
That boys just a walkaway joe
Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arms
But shell just keep reachin on
cause the cold hard truth revealed
What it had known  
That boys just a walkaway joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
Hes the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boys just a walkaway joe
All he was was a walkaway joe
Ooh walkaway joe  
Ooh he was a walkaway joe
Ooh walkaway joe  
Yes he was a walkaway joe  
Its her first night on the town since she was just eighteen
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
The ties that once bound her now are broke away
And shes like a baby just learning how to play
She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a midsummer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday

Now shes a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
Shes got her freedom but shed rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down

Well I know a lady thats down on her love
Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasnt there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldnt live with a man she couldnt trust

I played the Red River Valley
And hed sit out in the kitchen and cry
An run his fingers through  years of living
An wonder Lord as ever will that drill run dry
We were friends me an this old man

Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train

Hes a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an oldschool man of the world
Hed let me drive his car when hes too drunk to
And hed wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie


From the time that I could walk hed take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
And there were old men with beerguts and dominoes
Lying about their lives while they play
And I was just a kid they called his sidekick


One day I looked up and hes pushing 
And theres brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me hes one of the heroes of this country
So why is he all dressed up like them old men
Drinking beer and playing Moon in 


The day before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed of supper kitchens
And sang another verse to that old song
Come on Jack that sonofaguns acoming

Baby when I met you there was peace on earth
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was somethin going on
You do something to me that I cant explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin goin on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together ahah
Makin love with each other ahah
Chorus
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one inbetween
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other ahah
From one lover to another ahah
I cant live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly loosen sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together ahah
Makin love with each other ahah
Repeat Chorus
Tag
Sail away
Oh come sail away with me
Repeat Chorus
Fade
Repeat Chorus
On the road again
I just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin places that Ive never been
Seein things that I may never see again
And I cant wait to get on the road again
Here we go on the road again
Like a band of Gypsies we go down the highway
Were the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin our way
And our way is on the road again
I just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again break free
And I cant wait to get on the road again
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Dont patronize
Dont patronize me
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
You cant make your heart feel something it wont
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and Ill feel the power
But you wont no you wont
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
Ill close my eyes
Then I wont see
The love you dont feel when youre holding me
Morning will come
And Ill do whats right
Just give me til then to give up this fight
And Ill give up this fight
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
You cant make your heart feel something it wont
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and Ill feel the power
But you wont no you wont
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
I like a man whos crazy about me
I like a man who can live without me too
Thats what I like about you
I like a man who will lay down beside me
I like a man who will stand up to me too
Thats what I like about you
I dont want a man to be my twin
Under my thumb under my skin
Dont want a man like a shadow on the ground
With nothin else to do but follow me around
I like a man who will cry on my shoulder
Who dont mind if I cry sometimes too
Thats what I like about you
I like a man who can make it happen
Who can get me laughin when my whole world breaks in two
Thats what I like about you
You can be soft honey you can be strong
Maybe thats the reason we get along
Everything you do you do just right
Youre tender in love tought in a fight
I like a man who will lay down beside me
Stand up to me cry on my shoulder crazy about me
Can live with out me too
Thats what I like about
Cant live my life without
Thats what I like about you
We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
Weve created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we dont possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So were shoppin every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Kaching
Can you hear it ring Kaching
It makes you wanna sing Kaching
Its such a beautiful thing
Kaching Kaching
Lots of diamond rings Kaching
The happiness it brings Kaching
Youll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When youre broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Kaching
Can you hear it ring Kaching
It makes you wanna sing Kaching
Its such a beautiful thing
Kaching Kaching
Lots of diamond rings Kaching
The happiness it brings Kaching
Youll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Dig deeper in your wallet

The closer you get the further I fall
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all
Im falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get the further I fall

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love


Could I be dreaming
Is this really real
Because theres something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight


Keep falling oh yeah yeah keep falling
Baby Ive been drifting away
Dreaming all day
Of holding you
Touching you
The only thing I wanna do
Is be with you
As close to you
As I can be

Lets make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Lets make love
Oh baby

Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you
Im so in love with you
Look in my eyes
Lets get lost tonight
In each other

Lets make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Lets make love

Theres a reason for the sunshining sky
And theres a reason
Why Im feeling so high
Must be the season when that
Love light shines all around us
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love cant hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean
Its the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason
Theres a reason for the warm sweet nights
And theres a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those
Love lights shine all around us
So let that wonder
Take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder
As it warms your face
You cant hold back
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean
Its the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean

And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason

And let your love grow
She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready
Now shes not so sure
She thought shed done some living
But now shes just wondering
What shes living for
Now shes feeling that theres something more

Is there life out there
So much she hasnt done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
Shes done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesnt want to leave
Shes just wondering
Is there life out there

Shes always lived for tomorrow
Shes never learned how
To live for today
Shes dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy
Or just get away
Something for herself for a change


Theres a place in the sun that shes never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then
She looks out the window and wonders again
I was just coastin never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to stayin there
And out of the blue I fell for you

Now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where youve always been
I was hiding in doubt til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new all because of you

And now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies yeah
You give me butterflies

Now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
Youre taking my hand stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didnt know him and I didnt know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
Skippin rocks skippin rope
Laughin at all my best friends jokes
Things I love when I was a kid

Muddy roads muddy feet
I didnt live on no black top street
Things have changed a lot but I never did

And I dont wanna think about tomorrow
I dont need anything money can buy
I dont have to beg steal or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

Livin right livin in
This little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams

Standin proud standin tall
Standin smack dab in the middle of it all
I dont worry about things that I cant change

And I dont wanna think about tomorrow
I dont need anything money can buy
I dont have to beg steal or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

And everything around me
Are things I dearly love
And every night i get on my knees
And thank the Lord above

That I dont have to think about tomorrow
I dont need anything money can buy
I dont have to beg steal or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

I dont have to beg steal or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Shes always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
Ive tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Fill the glass up to the top
Ill start with loving her
But I dont know when to stop

I wake up and right away
Her name is on my lips
Once the memories start to flow
I cant stop with just one sip

Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Shes always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
Ive tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Fill the glass up to the top
Ill start with loving her
But I dont know when to stop

I keep on remembering
How good it used to be
Gettin stoned all alone
On my favorite memory

Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Shes always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
Ive tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit Ive got a thinkin problem
Fill the glass up to the top
Ill start with loving her
But I dont know when to stop
Ill start with lovin her
But I dont know when to stop
Everybody wants a little piece of my time
But still I put you at the end of the line
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
To see the tears you cry fallin like rain
Give me the chance to prove
And Ill make it up to you

I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standing so strong and true
Baby I still believe in you and me

Somewhere along the way I guess I just lost track
Only thinkin of myself never lookin back
For all the times Ive hurt you I apologize
Im sorry it took so long to finally realize
Give me the chance to prove
That nothings worth losing you
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her round the playground
Across the monkey bars to the merrygoround
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Now were grown up and shes my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Aint much changed I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together she still gets to me
Cant believe its been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said yes mam fill her up
Tell me something good that I dont know
Cause this worlds been kicking my behind
Life aint been a friend of mine
Lately Ive been feeling kinda low

And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said

Everythings gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
And nobodys gotta worry bout nothing
Dont go hittin that panic button
It aint worth spilling your drink
Everythings gonna be alright
Alright alright

So I nodded my head and said thats for sure
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea

And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said

Everythings gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
Nobodys gotta worry bout nothing
Dont go hitting that panic button
It aint near as bad as you think
Everythings gonna be alright
Alright alright

There aint no doubt its gonna work out
Come on sing it with me
There aint no doubt its gonna work out
Come on and sing it with me

Everythings gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
And nobodys gotta worry bout nothing
Dont go hitting that panic button
It aint near as bad as you think
Everythings gonna be alright
Alright is gonna be alright alright is gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
Alright is gonna be alright alright is gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
Is gonna be alright is gonna be alright
Everythings gonna be alright
Is gonna be alright is gonna be alright
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when Im gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool Ive been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They wont be reaching out for you no more

But dont tell my heart my achy breaky heart
I just dont think hed understand
And if you tell my heart my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise tell anything you please
Myself already knows Im not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But dont tell my heart my achy breaky heart
I just dont think hed understand
And if you tell my heart my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man ooh

Dont tell my heart my achy breaky heart
I just dont think hed understand
And if you tell my heart my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Dont tell my heart my achy breaky heart
I just dont think hed understand
And if you tell my heart my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man oohooh
That lonesome Texas sun was setting slow
And in the rearview mirror
I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment
Im still there

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

Another town
Another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely praying before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

For every heart you break
You pay a price
But I cant forget the tears in her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
How can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Everywhere I go theyre starin at her
Every man I know he wants to have her
I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I look the other way theyre hittin on her
Every night and day they telephone her
They try and get to her but I know they cant

Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin she starts walkin
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

She walks into the room and everybody
Watches every move hopin she dont love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they dont realize theres more to her
Than what meets the eye thats why I am certain
No matter what they do to reach her now

She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin she starts walkin
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

When they start talkin she starts walkin
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart
Never lets it go to her heart
I heard a freight train out across the way
I heard a woman sing amazing grace
I heard a night bird call to its mate
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard freedom break its chain
I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lightin and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
Strapped on my holster low across my hips
Two Colt s with black plastic grips
And Id head west through our neighborhood
And theyd say
Here comes young Billy and hes up to no good
I rode a trail through the neighbors backyard
Shootin the Bad Guys through my handlebars
Known for my bravery both far and near
Bein late for supper was my only fear
I miss Billy the Kid
The times that he had
The life that he lived
I guess he mustve got caught
His innocence lost
I wonder where he is
I miss Billy the Kid
These days I dont know whose side to be on
Theres such a thin line between Right and Wrong
I live and learn do the best I can
But theres only so much you can do as a man
I miss Billy the Kid
The times that he had
The life that he lived
I guess he mustve got caught
His innocence lost
Lord I wonder where he is
I miss Billy the Kid
Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
A man holding on to a woman letting go

Theres a man with a bottle on the other side of town
Swimming with a memory that he cant drown
Lord it aint sunk in that she aint coming home
Oh a man holding on to a woman letting go

His heart is telling him
To hang on for dear life
Cause deep down he knows
Shes letting go for good this time

Theres a daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
Fighting back tears and forcing a smile
Oh for twentytwo years hes watched her grow
A man holding on to a woman letting go

In the Hill Valley Home theres a feeble old man
And hes holding on to a fragile old hand
And the angels are coming to carry her home
Now hes a man holding on to a woman letting go

His heart is telling him
To hang on for dear life
Cause deep down he knows
Shes letting go for good this time

Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
Oh a man holding on to a woman letting go
A man holding on to a woman a woman letting go
Wish that I was on ole Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Aint no smoggy smoke up on Rocky Top
Aint no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on ole Rocky Top
Part bear the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that
Rocky Top youll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin for a moonshine still
Strangers aint come down from ol Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn wont grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirts too rocky by far
Thats why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Rocky Top youll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top youll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennessee
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts made the start it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed disassembled rearranged
We came together fell apart
And broke each others hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love we found trust
Vowed wed never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn back its just a steppin stone
To where we are
Where weve been
Said wed do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We wont be sad well be glad
For all the life weve had
And well remember when
I dont really care bout making any plans
Leave it up in the air give it up to chance
Seein where it goes seein where it lands

And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin in the back seat to the radio

The Devil went down to Georgia He was lookin for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin on a fiddle and playin it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said Boy let me tell you what
I guess you didnt know it but Im a fiddle player too
And if youd care to take a dare Ill make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy but give the Devil his due
Ill bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think Im better than you
The boy said My names Johnny and it might be a sin
But Ill take your bet and youre gonna regret cause Im the best theres ever been
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hells broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul
The Devil opened up his case and he said Ill start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished Johnny said Well youre pretty good ol son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how its done
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run
The Devils in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite No child no

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnnys feet
Johnny said Devil just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you onceyou son of a bitchIm the best theres ever been
And he played
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run
The Devils in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny will your dog bite No child no
I know youve heard that worn out line
About love at first sight
Well I never knew those words were true
Till you walked in tonight
All it took was just one look
To knock me off my feet
Im not a man of many words
So Ill make this short and sweet
Could ya would ya aint ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
Yeah Id take a chance slow dance make a little romance
Honey itll be alright

And a kissin and a holdin each other tight

Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
She walks into Smokeys
One hip at a time
Like a broken field runner
Slippin through the lines
He likes the way she looks
So he calls a little wife
Says dont wait up for me
Ill be workin late tonight
Wife hangs up the phone bursts into tears
Calls her sister up and cries get over here
Sister tells her boyfriend be back in awhile
Boyfriend wants a beer the store is just a mile
Leaves the motor runnin hell only be a minute
His car drives away with teenagers in it
Driver tells his buddies got one life to live
They scream into the night lets get it over with
Cause and effect chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When were spinnin round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth third rock from the sun
The kid guns the gas car starts to swerve
Heads for a semitruck jumps the curb
Truck hits a bigboy in the Shoneys parking lot
Flies through the air takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole transformer sparks
Lines go down town goes dark
Waitress calls the cops says she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the mayor says theres panic in the street
Hate to wake you up but we cant find the chief
Mayor says use your head if he aint in his car
Hes hiding from his wife down at Smokeys bar
Cause and effect chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When were spinnin round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth third rock from the sun
Cause and effect chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When were spinnin round
Things come undone
Welcome to the earth third rock from the sun
Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun

Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
Youve been looking for love
All around the world
Baby dont you know
This country girls still free
Why not me
Well youve finally come down
To your old hometown
Your Kentucky girls been waiting patiently
Why not me

Why not me
On a rainy day
Why not me
To love your cares away
Why not me
Why not me
When the nights get cold
Why not me
When youre growing old
Why not me

Youve been searching
From here to Singapore
Aint it time
That you notice the girl next door baby
Why not me
You had to see if the world was round
Its time that you learned
How good settling down could be
Why not me


Youve been looking for love
All around the world
Baby dont you know
This country girls still free

Baby why not me
When I saw you buying Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine
I said to myself now theres a girl for me
And when I asked you to go for a ride
You stole my heart when you said if I can drive
I said how bout some music you said you got any Merle
Thats when I knew you were my kind of girl
And when we started talking I could not believe my ears
You said you were a Braves fan even through the rotten years
You quoted William Faulkner and Martin Luther King
You said your favourite movie star would always be James Dean
And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
Thats when I knew you were my kind of girl

Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
Were peas in a pod girl were two of a kind

I said I think I love you you said whats not to love
I thought about a kiss but I wasnt quick enough
I guess while I was thinking you were reading my mind
Cause you wrapped your arms around me and you pressed your lips to mine
You sent my head spinning like a TiltaWhirl
Thats when I knew you were my kind of girl
You sent my head spinning like a TiltaWhirl
Thats when I knew you were my kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
Youre my kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein made of gold
I dont know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin Amarillo
Takin that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I cant forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Cause leavin didnt hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance Id lie again

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile
Well I aint afraid of dyin its the thought of being dead
I want to go on being me once my eulogys been read
Dont spread my ashes out to sea dont lay me down to rest
You can put my mind at ease if you fill my last request
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord I want to go to heaven but I dont want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
Just let my headstone be a neon sign
Just let it burn in memory of all of my good times
Fix me up with a mannequin just remember I like blondes
Ill be the life of the party even when Im dead and gone
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord I want to go to heaven but I dont want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
Just make your next selection and while youre still in line
You can pay your last respects one quarter at a time
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord I want to go to heaven but I dont want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
She was sittin all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin by a Georgia plate
I was lookin for her boyfriend
Thinkin no way she aint got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin in love
Tryin to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Id gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin like a fool AM FM XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man you should have seen her light up

She was like oh my God this is my song
Weve been listenin to the radio all night long
I cant believe that it came back on but here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

And she said play it again play it again play it again
The next Friday night we were sittin out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like oh my God this is my song
Ive been listenin to the radio all night long
Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
She was like come here boy I wanna dance
Fore I said a word she was takin my hand
Spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said play it again play it again play it again
And I said play it again play it again play it again

Yeah play it again play it again play it again
Somebody play it again play it again play it again

When it rains it pours
But you didnt even notice
It aint rainin anymore
Its hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin above the risin water line

Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin
But youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

If you could see what I see
Youd be blinded by the colors
Yellow red and orange and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat take off your coat and take a look around

Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin
But youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

Oh tie up the boat take off your coat and take a look around

Let go of your umbrella
Cause darlin Im just tryin to tell ya
That theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head
Yeah theres always been a rainbow hangin over your head

Itll all be alright
Big orange ball sinking in the water
Toes in the sand couldnt get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil tanning seoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

Ive been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
Ive done some living yeah Ive had fun
But there is one thing that I havent done

Saved two months bought a little diamond
Tonights the night feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on mommas front steps
Man Im going to die if she really says yes

Done almost everything a boy can do
Ive done some living yeah Ive had fun
But there is one thing that I havent done

It sure is good to see you girl
Youre still the only one
Youre looking just as lovely
As the day our love was born
Remember when you told me
I could make it on my own
Without you here to hold me
Im afraid Im not that strong
Happy ever afters not so easy to aquire
Only you could ever measure up to my desire
Baby you gave up on me just a little bit too soon
And left me here for lonely howling at the moon
All I need is one more chance to prove my love for you
I tried my best to live without you
You hold the power in your hands
You and only you can make these broken dreams come true
Im asking your forgiveness
I know Im the one to blame
Ive finally learned my lesson
Love is more than just a game
And please dont try to tell me
A little time is all I need
Cause time he aint no friend of mine
Til he brings you back to me
All I need is one more chance to prove my love for you
I tried my best to live without you
You hold the power in your hands
You and only you can make these broken dreams come true
All I need is one more chance to prove my love for you
I tried my best to live without you
You hold the power in your hands
You and only you can make these broken dreams come true
Only you can make these broken dreams come true

Can you feel it
Come come come on baby
I feel like a woman
Well I woke up this morning stumbled out of my rack
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
It only took a minute for my finger to find
My daily dose of destiny under my sign
My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said The stars are stacked against you girl get back in bed

I feel lucky I feel lucky yeah
No Professor Doom going to stand in my way
Mmm I feel lucky today

Well I strolled down to the corner gave my numbers to the clerk
The pots eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels a burrito and a Barqs
Crossed against the light made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying Girl you better get back home

But I feel lucky oh oh oh I feel lucky yeah
No tropical depression going to steal my sun away
Mmm I feel lucky today

Now eleven million later I was sitting at the bar
Id bought the house a double and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakams in the corner trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovetts right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story its simple but its true
Hey the stars might lie but the numbers never do
Chorus
I feel lucky
Oh oh oh
I feel lucky yeah
Hey Dwight hey Lyle boys you dont have to fight
Hot dog Im feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky brr I feel lucky yeah
Think Ill flip a coin Im a winner either way
Mmm I feel lucky today
Youre back at my door
The one you walked out
You made a mistake
You know that now
Will I let you in Youre begging me please
What if I do
Whats in it for me
REFRAIN
Whats in it for me
Ive got to ask
If its only more tears then Ill have to pass
If youll open up then I can see
Deep in your heart whats in it for me
Well I have to admit
Im glad that youre here
But I cant make the past just disappear
If youre back for good I want you to be
Just let me know whats in it for me
REFRAIN
Am I a fool
To think youve changed
Some people do is that so strange
Our love was good just got off track
Is it worth the risk if you come back
REFRAIN
If youll open up then I can see
Deep in your heart whats in it for me
Ill give you the best best you baby
Thats all I can give
And well live the best we can live it baby
As long a we as live
What kind of love never turns you down
What kind of love lifts you off the ground
Turns your life around
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind and driving rain
What kind of love runs through your heart with a pleasure so close to pain
What kind of love
Only this love that I have
Ill show you the best I can show you baby
Thats all I can I show you
And Ill know you the best I can know you baby
As long as I know you
What kind of love never turns away
What kind of love never makes you pay
Hears you when you pray
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind and driving rain
What kind of love runs through your heart with a pleasure so close to pain
What kind of love only this love that I have
This love I know is all I have all I have
This love I have is all I know
So I wont let go
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind and driving rain
What kind of love runs through your heart with a pleasure so close to pain
What kind of love only this love that I have
Its amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you dont say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me
The touch of your hand says youll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mr Webster could never define
Whats being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me
The touch of your hand says youll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me
The touch of your hand says youll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
I hear the train a comin its rolling round the bend
And I aint seen the sunshine since I dont know when
Im stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin on
But that train keeps a rollin on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me Son
Always be a good boy dont ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry

I bet theres rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
Theyre probably drinkin coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming I know I cant be free
But those people keep amovin
And thats what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet Id move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison thats where I want to stay
And Id let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
Gonna hold who needs holdin
Mend what needs mendin
Walk what needs walkin
Though it means an extra mile
Pray what needs prayin
Say what needs sayin
Cause were only here for a little while
Today I stood singin songs and sayin Amen
Saying goodbye to an old friend who seemed so young
He spent his life workin hard to chase a dollar
Putting off until tomorrow the things he should have done
Made me start thinking Whats the hurry why the runnin
I dont like what Im becoming gonna change my style
Take my time and I take it all for granted 
Cause were only here for a little while
Gonna hold who needs holdin
Mend what needs mendin
Walk what needs walkin
Though it means an extra mile
Pray what needs prayin
Say what needs sayin
Cause were only here for a little while
Let me love like Ill never see tomorrow
Treat each day as though its borrowed
Like its precious as a child
Whoa take my hand
Let us reach out to each other
Cause were only here for a little while
Gonna hold who needs holdin
Mend what needs mendin
Walk what needs walkin
Though it means an extra mile
Pray what needs prayin
Say what needs sayin
Cause were only here for a little while
Gonna hold who needs holdin
Mend what needs mendin
Walk what needs walkin
Though it means an extra mile
Pray what needs prayin
Say what needs sayin
Cause were only here for a little while
Tumble outta bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin and stretchin and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin
With folks like me on the job from  to 

Working  to 
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin by
Its all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
Its enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

 to  for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss wont seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
Youre just a step
On the boss mans ladder
But you got dreams hell never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tides gonna turn
An its all gonna roll you away

Working  to 
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin by
Its all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
Its enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it
 to  yeah they got you where they want you
Theres a better life
And you think about it dont you
Its a rich mans game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

This thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing this thing called love called love
It cries like a baby in a cradle at night
It swings it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

I gotta be cool relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready
Crazy little thing called love
When I go dont cry for me
In my fathers arms Ill be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and Ill be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus face
And I will not be ashamed
For my saviour knows my name

It dont matter where you bury me
Ill be home and Ill be free
It dont matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away

Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heavens store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own dont fill up half
But dont you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

On a lonely highway stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
Youre right there in everything I do

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything Ill ever need
Im carrying your love with me
Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around Ill always be around and around and around and
Around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
Ill find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And Ill be back again and again and again and again and again
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Dont go looking for the reasons
Dont go asking Jesus why
Were not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
Theyve all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Well Ive been called a selfmade man
And girl dont you believe its true
I know exactly how lucky I am
When Im gettin this close to you
Its high time Im givin some praise
To those that got me where I am today

I got to thank Mama for the cookin
Daddy for the whoopin
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you

A strong heart and a willin hand

A good job Lord I know Ive been blessed

Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I aint seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if Ill ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I cant look at you while Im lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I cant look at you while Im lying next to her

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they wont tell
But their halfhearted smiles tell me something just aint right
Ive been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin up on heartaches and cheap wine
I aint heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where youve been
I cant look at you while Im lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where youve been
I cant look at you while Im lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same how have you been
Since youve been gone my worlds been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Cant seem to get you off my mind
I cant understand why were living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear Ill change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I found your picture today
I swear Ill change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

I just called to say I love you
Come back home
Songwriters  Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow
Hey

She is the restless river running through my veins
She rides without the reins

Dont need no copy of vogue magazine
Dont need to dress like no Beauty Queen
High heels or sneakers he dont give a damn
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am
He never tells me Im not good enough
Just gives me unconditional love
He loves me tender he loves me mad
He loves me silly and he loves me sad

He thinks Im pretty he thinks Im smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
Hes always saying hes my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am

When theres dark clouds in my eyes
He just sits back and lets em roll on by
Come in like a lion and go out like a lamb
My baby loves me just the way that I am 

He thinks Im pretty he thinks Im smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
Hes always saying hes my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am
Baby close that suitcase lets turn this thing around
Weve got everybody talking all over town
But if you have to leave well keep one thing in mind
Oh this ones gonna hurt you for a long long time
Theres a bottle on the table to help me understand
How love can go so wrong between a woman and a man
But just beyond the door heres what you will find
Girl this ones gonna hurt you for a long long time
A long long time is forever
And will I get over you probably never
You cant walk away from true love
And leave your feelings all behind
Cause this ones gonna hurt you for a long long time
A long long time is forever
And will I get over you probably never
You cant walk away from true love
And leave your feelings all behind
Oh this ones gonna hurt you for a long long time
You cant walk away from true love
Leave your feelings all behind
Ah this ones gonna hurt you for a long long time
Shes fifteen and hes barely driving a car
Shes got his ring and hes got the keys to her heart
Its just matter of time
Theyll spread their wings and fly
CHORUS
Two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
Theyve heard its all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says theyll never make it love says they will
Theres a baby crying and one more on the way
Theres a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills
They cant pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side
Go to chorus
Shes eightythree and hes barely driving a car
Shes got his ring and hes got the key to her heart
Its just a matter of time
Theyll spread their wings and fly
Go to chorus 
CHORUS 
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
Theyve heard its all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says theyll never make it love says they will
She left the car in the driveway
She left the key in the door
She left the kids at her mamas
And the laundry piled up on the floor
She left her ring on the pillow
Right where it wouldnt be missed
She left a note in the kitchen
Next to the grocery list
It said you dont even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You dont even know who I am
So what do you care if I go
He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldnt remember what for
So he said Ive been doing some thinking
Ive been thinking that maybe youre right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night
And you dont even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You dont even know who I am
So what do I care if you go
You dont even know who I am
So what do I care if you go
Now I dont wanna lose you
But I dont wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I dont wanna hate you
I dont wanna take you
But I dont wanna be the one to cry

And that dont really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But theres a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know its your heart you cant trust
Theres a reason why people dont stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just aint enough

Now I could never change you
I dont want to blame you
Baby you dont have to take the fall
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking somethings gonna change

But theres a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know its your heart you cant trust
Theres a reason why people dont stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just aint enough

And theres no way home
When its late at night and youre all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And theres a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know its your heart they cant touch
Theres a reason why people dont stay who they are
Baby sometimes love just aint enough
Baby sometimes love
It just aint enough oh no no

And a fighters heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl you did so good

Hey pretty girl when I see the light
And its my time to go
Im gonna thank the Lord for a real good life
A pretty little girl and a beautiful wife
It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go if we
Cleaned it up and got it running
Daddys old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it
To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Like a storm time rolls on
You cant hit pause thats just the deal
Most days in life dont stand out
But lifes about those days that we all like
Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
til the Alabama sun was breaking
Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind
Tonight Im in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Heres to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Talladega
Talladega
I woke up this morning
My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
Well its her way of sayin shes on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin
And I cant even think
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
In this complicated world
It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure
Push to the limit
Im standin at the brink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that wont hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff

Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have all of this and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that wont run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think

Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have all of this and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Do I want too much
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
Give me what I deserve cause its my right

Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have this
Shouldnt I have all of this and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
An old cowboy went riding out
One dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of redeyed cows he saw
A Plowing through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy drawl

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
Hes riding hard to catch that herd
But he aint caught em yet
Because theyve got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him
As He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
From Riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devils herd
Across these endless skies

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky
American girls and American guys
Well always stand up and salute well always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying theres a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard til the day that he died
He wanted my mother my brother my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue

Oh justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And youll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause well put a boot in your ass its the American way

Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue

Oh oh
Of the red white and blue
Oh oh
Of my red white and blue
I was drivin through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

Well I wasnt in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl

When the band started playin the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin that you aint never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go
She dipped down spun around and docedoed

She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl

If your ever down in Georgia around about July
If you aint in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that youre goin have a ball
Learnin how to do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl
Yeah do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
Do the watermelon crawl
Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didnt ask for money or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you

One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe Id be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

First thing Id do is pray for time to crawl
Id unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
Id hold you every second
Say a million I love yous
Thats what Id do with one more day with you

One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe Id be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day
One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe Id be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day one more day
Blue
Oh so lonesome for you
Why cant you be blue over me
Blue
Oh so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes
Til I cant see

Three oclock in the morning
Here am I
Sitting here so lonely
So lonesome I could cry

Blue
Oh so lonesome for you
Why cant you be blue over me

Now that its over
I realize
Those weak words you whispered
Were nothing but lies

Blue
Oh so lonesome for you
Why cant you be blue over me
Why cant you be blue over me
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And Im tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized youre all I ever wanted
And its killin me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so oh I told you so
I told you some day youd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that oldtime feelin would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that youve missed me too and that youve been so lonely
And youve waited for the day that I returned
And wed live and love forever and that Im your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
Would you say

I told you so oh I told you so
I told you some day youd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
Nothing ever happened without cause Cause BM condition WM wont face WM obsessed with hiding his guilt
If Christianity had asserted itself in Germany six million Jews would have lived
WM so quick to tell BM Look what I have done for you No Look what you have done to us
BM dealing with WM who put our eyes out now he condemns us because we cannot see
I have wife who understands or even if she doesnt she at least pretends
BM struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless BM first forms own united front
Sit down talk with people with brains I respect all of us want same thing do some brainstorming
Also Learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind Persian poet
joined in laughter and we walked on with Malcolm X waving back to cries of Hes right
Look tell me the truth Malcolm X said to me one evening you travel around Have you heard anything
Truthfully I told him I didnt know what he had reference to He dropped it and talked of something else
Well ElHajj Malik ElShabazz How are you
He said Just a little bit tired He had arrived on a PanAmerican
Do we correctly understand that you now do not think that all whites are evil

I couldnt help but just break out grinning Sister Betty would later tell me
Soon some Negro men entered the giant hotels busy lobby
Oh dont mention it she said quickly I understand
Asalaikum salaam some in the audience responded
A team of surgeons cut through his chest to attempt to massage the heart The effort was abandoned at  PM

Bye bye
Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldnt know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in nineteen sixtyfour
My grandfather was a drinker back in the day hed put em down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskeys known to change a man

But thats not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but Ill smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldnt go in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all Ill ever be

Now its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in LA
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset he put me up at the Marquee
He said You wanna sell a million records boy You better listen to me

He said Change your style whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life youd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around

I said no thats not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old tshirts and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
Cause a country boy is all Ill ever be

Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
Youll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourtyfive
Ive got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck and my idea of heavens chasin white tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive

Now two flags fly above my land and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud the red the white the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
Dont tread on me is what it says and Ill take that to my grave

Because this is me
Im proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again cause Ive never needed government to hold my hand
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again cause my familys always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all Ill ever be

I love my country I love my guns I love my family I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes cause this is America and a country boy is good enough for me son
Six lanes taillights
Red ants marchin into the night
They disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A ninetynine cent heart attack
I got a poundin head and an achin back
And the camels buried in a big straw stack

Im gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed
Point our rockin chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well Im from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
I caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is agettin dark
Theres concrete growin in the city park
I dont know who my neighbors are
And theres bars on the corners and bars on my heart

Im gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed
Point our rockin chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Im gonna live where the green grass grows
Watchin my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed
Point our rockin chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
Its littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true
When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that shes been through
CHORUS
When she cries at night
And she doesnt think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
Cause I die a little each time
When she cries
Shes always been there for me
Whenever Ive fallen
When nobody else believes
Shell be there by my side
I dont know how she takes it
Just once Id like to make it
Then therell be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes
CHORUS
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
Cause I die a little each time
When she cries
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a ninepound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in fourwheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking

Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hoodsliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddys in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a comeandgetme grin
And like a bullet we were gone again cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking
If you leave me I wont miss you
And I wont ever take you back
Girl your memory wont ever haunt me
Cause I dont love you and now if youll buy that

I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free

I dont worship the ground you walk on
I never have and thats a fact
I wont follow or try to find you
Cause I dont love you and now if youll buy that


Yeah if youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free
You look surprised you didnt think youd see me
Kickin up my heels paintin up this town
When you said goodbye
I learned a couple new dances
Cast a couple of glances Im on a big roll now
Chorus
Except for Monday which was never good anyway
Tuesday I get a little sideways
Wednesday I feel better just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it Saturdays gone
But its Sunday now
And you can bet that Im alright
Instrumental
Dont get me wrong it wasnt always this easy
Gettin over you got a little rough on me
It didnt take too long til I got it together
And everyday I thank my lucky stars
You set me free
Except for Monday which was never good anyway
Tuesday I get a little sideways
Wednesday I feel better just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it Saturdays gone
But its Sunday now
And you can bet that Im alright
Instrumental
Repeat Chorus
Its Sunday now and everythings alright
Why lady why cant I leave you alone
I try lady try but the feelings too strong
You stay on my mind feel just like a fool
Why lady why cant I get over you
Why lady why it was easy before
I try lady try but it aint easy no more
To be on my way would be the best thing to do
Why lady why cant I get over you
Why lady why cant I leave you alone
I try lady try but the feelings too strong
To be on my way would be the best thing to do
Why lady why cant I get over you
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

Ill be good to him
Ill bring love to him
Everyone says therell come a day
When Ill walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why cant he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad I couldnt tell
I missed the point I missed the signs
So if shes gone the fault is mine
I know I know a whole lot of little things
And even though I confess them one by one
She would still be gone

Her eyes are blue her hair is long
In  she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is In My Life
I memorized her every move
I knew her books her car her cloths
But I paid no attention to what mattered most

I never asked she never said
And when she cried I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors
That made them easy to ignore
And I know I know I missed the forest for the trees
And all I have to show oh when she walked out the door
The cold facts and nothing more


Her eyes are blue her hair is long
In  she was born in Baton Rouge
Her fathers tall her mothers gone
She moved out west when she was two
The way she laughed the way she loved
Oh my God what did I do
Baby tell me whered you ever learn
To fight without saying a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like its all gonna be alright
Dont you know how much it hurts

When we dont talk when we dont touch
When it doesnt feel like were even in love
It matters to me
When I dont know what to say dont know what to do
Dont know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me

Maybe I still dont understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
Cause Im not sure I can

When we dont talk when we dont touch
When it doesnt feel like were even in love
It matters to me
When I dont know what to say dont know what to do
Dont know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me


Oh when I dont know what to say dont know what to do
Dont know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
Oh it matters to me
Oh it matters to me
It matters to me
Every little move she makes
Is gonna catch somebodys eye
You ought to see all the doubletakes
When she goes walkin by
But shes so distant
She seems so cold
Everybody says that rock wont roll
They say the girls got a heart of stone
That rock wont roll
Oh but shes too pretty to be alone
Ive got all this love inside me
And Ive just got to see
If that rock wont roll
Ill give her everything Ive got
Im gonna change her point of view
Ill keep tryin and I wont stop
Until the love in her eyes shines through
When I show her
This heart of gold
Then well see if that rock wont roll
They say the girls got a heart of stone
That rock wont roll
Oh but shes too pretty to be alone
Ive got all this love inside me
And Ive just got to see
If that rock wont roll
Instrumental Break
Ive got all this love inside me
And Ive just got to see
If that rock wont roll
Oh shes so pretty
But that rock wont roll
Oooh and Ive just got to see
To Fade
If that rock wont roll
That rock wont roll
I just cant believe that rock wont roll
Any time love is on the table the stakes are high
But I thought this was love so I laid it all on the line
You nearly took everything I had
Never knew I could hurt so bad
But I least I left with every pieace of this heart of mine
Chorus
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know Ill be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
It was a hard way to go when I didnt know when to leave
If you knew all along baby you werent telling me
Now I know I could live or die
Im heading down the right road now
Still believeing in a way
That a real love is meant to be
Chorus
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know Ill be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know Ill be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner
Touch me turn me on and burn me down
Your lips hold a wild desire
And give a kiss like the devils fire
Your kind of love could burn a town
Oh touch me turn me on and burn me down
Your touch brings me to my knees
Youve got me begging please please please
Take my heart and melt it down
Touch me turn me on and burn me down
Youre a wild love I cant tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when youre around
So touch me turn me on and burn me down
Im devoured by your fiery flame
My lips can only speak your name
Just spread my ashes all around
Oh touch me turn me on and burn me down
Youre a wild love I cant tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when youre around
So touch me turn me on and burn me down
Touch me turn me on and burn me down
Dont mean to get a little forward with you
Dont mean to get ahead of where we are
Dont mean to act a little nervous around you
Just a little nervous about my heart
Because its been awhile since I felt this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
Its been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

Didnt expect to be in this position
Didnt expect to have to rise above
My reputation for cynicism
Been a jaded lady when it comes to love

But oh baby just to feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
Its been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

Theres something bout the silent type
Attracting me to you
All business baby none of the hype
That no talker can live up to

Come closer baby I cant hear you
Just another whisper if you please
Dont worry bout the details darling
Youve got the kind of mind I love to read
Talk is cheap and baby times expensive
So why waste another minute more
And lifes too short to be so apprehensive
Loves as much the symptom darling as the cure

Oh baby when I feel this feeling
Its like genuine voodoo hits me
Its been too long since somebody whispered

Oh baby I can feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
Its been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me
Lazy yellow moon comin up tonite
Shinin thru the trees
Crickets are singin and lightning bugs
Are floatin on the breeze
Baby get ready
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stone road
Im gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get readyOooooooOooo
You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
Well be fallin in love in the middle of the night
Just movin slow
Stayin the whole night thru feels so good to be with you
Spring is almost over and the summers comin
The days are gettin long
Waited all winter for the time to be right just to take you along
Baby get ready
And it dont matter if we sit forever and the fish dont bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get readyOoooooooOoo

You and me going fishin in the dark
You may think that Im talking foolish
Youve heard that Im wild and Im free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
Youre not just time that Im killing
Im no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  oh baby

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Ill be happy to tell you again
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey I dont care I aint in love with your hair
And if it all fell out well Id love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well its easy to see its happening to me
Ive already forgotten every woman but you  oh darling

Im gonna love you forever forever and ever Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful
Well just listen to how this song ends
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Im gonna love you forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever forever and ever Amen
Grandpa
Tell me bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This worlds gone crazy
Grandpa take me back to yesterday
Where the line between right and wrong
Didnt seem so hazy
Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me bout the good old days
Musical interlude
Grandpa
Everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just dont know
And Grandpa lets wonder back into the past
And paint me a picture of long ago
Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me bout the good old days
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me bout the good ole days
Musical interlude
Humming
Some people just want things
I just follow my dreams
I know when I die
Memories will stay alive
Stoked on life
White dove looking for love
Stoked on life
One day well all we gone
Stoked on life
Dont let time pass you by
Stoked on life
Now lets have some fun
Some people never try
Let life just pass them by
Ill be true to myself
Follow nobody else
Stoked on life
White dove looking for love
Stoked on life
One day well all we gone
Stoked on life
Dont let time pass you by
Stoked on life
Now lets have some fun
Life
Life
Stoked on life
White dove looking for love
Stoked on life
One day well all we gone
Stoked on life
Dont let time pass you by
Stoked on life
Now lets have some fun
Some people just want things
I just follow my dreams
I know when I die
Memories will stay alive
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water thats no longer runnin under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank Im So Lonesome I Could Cry
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Ill be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Ill be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Neon lights flashing bright til youre almost hypnotized
Waitress short skirt gets hit on by every guy
Comin and goin always rollin with the flow
Bartender pour our drinks Cdigo do a shot
You think youre tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says youre not
You step outside thinkin youre gonna show em you are
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night its a given
Well be LIVN livin
Well dance on the bar til were sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning its a given
Well be DRAGN draggin
And thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah thats what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Well it was all
That I could do to keep from crying
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you dont have to call me darling darling
You never even call me by my name

You dont have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you dont have to call me Charlie Pride
And you dont have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
Even though youre on my fighting side

And Ill hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing in the rain
But you dont have to call me darlin darlin
You never even called me by my name

Well Ive heard my name
A few times in your phone book hello hello
And Ive seen it on signs where Ive played
But the only time I know
Ill hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day


Well a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country  western song
I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was
Not the perfect country  western song because he hadnt said anything at all about mama
Or trains
Or trucks
Or prison
Or getting drunk
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song
And he sent it to me
And after reading it
I realized that my friend had written the perfect
Country  western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here

Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got run over by a damned old train

And Ill hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing in the rain
No a you dont have to call me darlin darlin
You never even call me
Well I wonder why you dont call me
Why dont you ever call me by my name
Dont rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
My heart aint ready
For the Rolling Stones
I dont feel like rocking
Since my babys gone
So dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
Ive been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request


I aint got nothing
Against rock and roll
But when your hearts been broken
You need a song thats slow
Aint nothing like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

Dont rock the jukebox
I want to hear George Jones
My heart aint ready
For the Rolling Stones
I dont feel like rocking
Since my babys gone
So dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Yeah dont rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Hello Darlin
Nice to see you
Its been a long time
Youre just as lovely
As you used to be
Hows your new love
Are you happy
Hope your doin fine
Just to know it
Means so much to me
Whats that Darlin
How am I doin
Guess Im doin alright
Except I cant sleep
And I cry all night til dawn
What Im trying to say
Is I love you and I miss you
And Im so sorry
That I did you wrong
Look up Darlin
Let me kiss you
Just for old time sake
Let me hold you
In my arms one more time
Thank you Darlin
May God bless you
And may each step you take
Bring you closer
To the things you seem to find
Goodbye Darlin
Gotta go now
Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back Darlin
Ill be waitin for you
Ive been walkin these streets so long
Singin the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustles the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
Theres been a load of compromisin
On the road to my horizon
But Im gonna be where the lights are shinin on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I dont even know
And offers comin over the phone
Well I really dont mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But youre down when youre ridin the train thats takin the long way
And I dream of the things Ill do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
Therell be a load of compromisin
On the road to my horizon
But Im gonna be where the lights are shinin on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin cards and letters from people I dont even know
And offers comin over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin card and letters from people I dont even know
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
Theres a rundown bar cross the railroad tracks
Ive got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smokefilled room
No telling how many tears Ive sat here and cried
Or how many lies that Ive lied
Telling my poor heart shell come back someday

Oh but Ill be alright
As long as theres light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
This hurt inside of me aint never gonna end

Oh but Ill be alright
As long as theres light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
Theres always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around Ill always be around and around and around and
Around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
Ill find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And Ill be back again and again and again and again and again
Verse 
Operator please connect me with 
I need to make apologies for what i didnt do
I sure do need to tell her that ive thought the whole thing through
And now its clear that she is what i should have held on to
Chorus
They say hindsights twentytwenty
But im nearly goin blind
From starin at her photograph and wishing she was mine
Its that same ole lost love story
Its sad but its true
There was a time when she was mine in 
Verse 
Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now i know how long my love will last
chorus
Losin my mind goin back in time to 
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and Ive
Never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When Im lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

Cause I can feel you breathe its washing over me
And suddenly Im melting into you
Theres nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch slow and steady rush
Baby isnt that the way that loves supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Im closer than Ive ever felt before
And I know and you know
Theres no need for words right now

Cause I can feel you breathe its washing over me
And suddenly Im melting into you
Theres nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch slow and steady rush
Baby isnt that the way that loves supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby isnt that the way that loves supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess its because I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
Over and over everybody makes my predictions
So if I get stoned Im just carrying on an old family tradition

I am very proud of my daddys name
Although his kind of music and mine aint exactly the same
Stop and think it over put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition

So dont ask me Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
If Im down in a honkytonk some ole slicks trying to give me friction
I said leave me alone Im singing all night long its a family tradition

Lord I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 
When that doctor asked me Son howd you get in this condition
I said ahey sawbones Im just carrying on an ole family tradition

So dont ask me Hank why do you drink Hank Why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
Stop and think it over try to put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition
Daddy rolling through a fourway
Mama singing to a hymnal
Woodpaneled family car
My nose up against the window
Flashing neon beer sign
People all around
Mom said dont pay them no mind
That aint your kinda crowd

Needing saving
Latenight chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heartbreaking
Moneywasting
Hellraising
Crazy people

I found an old shoebox I wasnt supposed to find
Had written right on top Summer 
Saw Mama in a twopiece hanging off a lifeguard stand
Daddy right beside her with a cold one in his hand

Needing saving
Latenight chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heartbreaking
Moneywasting
Hellraising

OVER BLACK WE SEE
CHYRON
A long time ago in front of a convenience store far far
away
EXT QUICK STOP YEARS AGODAY
We FADE IN on the block of stores Quick StopRST from
sometime ago In fact RST isnt RST its THE RECORD RACK 
a s store with head shop paraphernalia in the window A
whitetrash MOTHER maybe seventeen wearing a baseball cap
comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY The Baby wears an
oversized tshirt under what looks like a little bathrobe
and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR There are food stamps in
the Mothers hands
MOTHER
BobbyBoy stay here while mommy picks
up the free cheese kay
She looks up at the bright sun shielding her eyes slightly
then looks back at the baby on the ground She takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby
MOTHER
Thisll keep the sun out of your
eyes You be good now
She walks away leaving the baby sitting against the wall
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard the kid looks
kind of familiar
Then another MOTHER also very young decked out in a KISS
concert shirt from years gone by and huge feathered hair
enters with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip
She sees the first Baby sitting against the wall and sets
her Baby down beside him
MOTHER
Dont fucking move you little shit

A PASSERBY enters heading toward the convenience store He
takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the
record store and then stops and addresses her disgusted
PASSERBY

MOTHER

one
PASSERBY

actors they despise yet cant stop
discussing This is where you go if
you wanna hear frustrated wouldbe

starting production this Friday on
their adaptation of underground comic

itll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
They putem in a bunch of movies
JAY
Who
HOLDEN
You knowthe guys from Good Will
Hunting
JAY
You mean the fucking movie with Mork
from Ork in it
HOLDEN
Yeah Im not too big a fan either
Though Affleck was the bomb in
Phantoms
JAY
Word bitch Phantoms like a
motherfucker
Holden and Jay slap hands Holden points at the monitor again
HOLDEN
Now down here is where you can gauge
the buzz This is the Shoot Back
area Its where people who read the
news get to chime in with their two
cents Heres what a guy who goes by
the chickmagnet Net handle of Wampa
One thinks about Bluntman and
Chronic
reading
Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only
work in small doses if at all They
dont deserve their own movie
to Jay
Hes got a point
JAY
Fuck him Whats the next one say
HOLDEN
reading
Bluntman and Chronic is the worst
comic I ever read Jay and Silent
Bob are stupid characters A couple
of stoners who spout dumbass
catchphrases like a thirdrate Cheech
and Chong or Bill and Ted Fuck Jay
and Silent Bob Fuck them up their
stupid asses
JAY
Who the fuck said that shit
HOLDEN
A guy who calls himself Magnolia
Fan  Check out what the guy after
him said Jay and Silent Bob are
terrible onenote jokes that only
stoners laugh at  Theyre fucking
clown shoes If they were real Id
beat the shit out of them for being
so stupid I cant believe Miramax
would have anything to so with this
shit I for one will be boycotting
this movie Whos with me
leans back
And then there are about fifty more
posts from people who agree to join
Spartacusheres boycott of the flick
JAY
grimly
Im gonna kill all these fucks
HOLDEN
Ah let it go Number one theyre a
bunch of jealous little dicks who
use the anonymity of the Net to insult
people whore doing what they wish
they were doing and number two
theyre not really talking about you
guysthey talking about Bluntman
and Chronic
JAY
But they said Jay and Silent Bob
They used our real names It doesnt
matter that theres a comic book
version of us and a real version
cause nobody knows were real in
real life
HOLDEN
Really
JAY
Yeah And all these people who read
that shit think the real Jay and
Silent Bob are a couple of faggots
cause of that all these dicks are
writing about the comic book Jay and
Silent Bob And maybe one night me
and Lunchboxll be macking some bitch
and shell be like Oooo I want to
suck youse guys dicks off Whats
your names  And Ill be like Jay
and Silent Bob And shell be like
OhI read on the Internet that
youse guys were little fucking
jerkoffs  And then she goes and
sucks two other guyss dicks off
instead Well fuck that  We gotta
put a stop to these hateful sonsa
bitches before they ruin our good
names
HOLDEN
First off I dont know how good
your names really are Secondly
theres not much you can do about
stopping this bile The Internets
given everyone in America a voice
and everyone in American has chosen
to use that voice to bitch about
movies As long as theres a Bluntman
and Chronic movie the Netnerds are
gonna have something negative to say
about it  Jay steams thinking
Then a light dawns on him
JAY
But wait a secondif there wasnt a
Bluntman and Chronic movie then no
one would be saying shit about Jay
and Silent Bob right
HOLDEN
Theyre not saying anything about
you nowtheyre talking about
fictional characters
JAY
oblivious to Holden
to Bob
So all we gotta do is stop em from
making the movie
HOLDEN
Yeah and kissoff the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties
youre due in the process Are you
fucking retarded Look Im probably
not alone in the opinion that this
flick is the worst idea since Greedo
shooting first I mean a Jay and
Silent Bob movie Who would pay to
see that
Holden Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for
a beat Then
HOLDEN
But since it is happening you might
as well just ignore the idiots on
the Internet go find Banky and get
your motherfucking movie check As
you so succinctly put it Thats
whats important here
JAY
No Holden McNeilwhats important
here is that theres a bunch of
motherfuckers we dont even know
calling us assholes on the Internet
to a bunch of teenagers and guys who
cant even get laid Putting a stop
to that is the most important thing
we could ever do
off monitor
When did it say theyre making that
movie

counts

other end is a glass case full of DIAMONDS
Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays
the air in the hallway She watches the decibel monitor
which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray Suddenly
within the mist laser beams become apparent
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few
steps back shaking her hands to limber up She then runs
forward and does an impressive series of flips down the
hallway not touching a single laser beam
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly
Once Sissys flipping comes to a stop at the other end of
the hallway near the Diamond case she makes a hand gesture
to Justice Justice nods and proceeds to do the same series
of flips down the hallway not tripping the alarm
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly
Justice lands beside Sissy and then Sissy gestures to
Chrissy
Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams
Sissy catches it and the monitor rises only slightly
Then Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips which are
even more impressive than the other two including running
up walls and pushing into handstand flips  When she passes
the last laser beam she lands between Sissy and Justice
arms in the air like a gymnast Then she lets out a loud
manly FART
The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING
through the building

them into a bag and races back down the hallway followed

attention away from the real heist
over here at the Diamond Exchange

scenario It sounds more like
something out of a bad movie

not only the artistic basis but also
the character basis for your
intellectual property Bluntman and
Chronic when we said property was
optioned by Miramax Films you were
legally obliged to secure our
permission to transfer the concept
to another medium As you failed to
do that youre in breach of the
original contractergo you find
yourself in a very actionable
position
Banky stares at Bob even more agog joined by Jay After a
beat Jay adds
JAY

Justice now has the advantage over Sissy holding her head
and kicking her in the face repeatedly screaming
BANKY
So what do you guys want to go

Missy and Chrissy knocking them out
Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting

a tranquilizer dart in his ass and SUZANNE standing behind

handiwork for a beat then calls off toward the Bluntmobile
JUSTICE

his face

boards and over the course of the next year while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out

INT NOWHERE
A familiar WOMAN closes a book thats marked THE VIEW
ASKEWNIVERSE She puts the book down smiles at us and skips

THE END
We go out to a party somewhere
The moment we walk in the door
People stop and everybody stares
She dont know what theyre staring for

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so

There she goes just walking down the street
And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her she just cant see
What the fuss is all about

And she dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so

Morning comes and her hairs all a mess
Thats when she thinks she looks her worst
Its times like this she dont know why
I cant take my eyes off her

Cause she dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her

She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind
She dont know shes beautiful
Though time and time Ive told her so
I brought flowers to your door last night
I done wrong and I wanna make it right
You say Im not welcome here
I know it oughta be perfectly clear
But I cant help but wonder what it might be like

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Oh I must have been a fool back then
To lose something that you cant have again
Ive done all that I know to do
Second guessed my every move
But I cant help but wonder how it might have been

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Baby could you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
On a warm summers evenin on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns astarin out the window at the darkness
Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said Son Ive made a life out of readin peoples faces
And knowin what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you dont mind my sayin I can see youre out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey Ill give you some advice

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said If youre gonna play the game boy
You gotta learn to play it right

You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin
Is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

You got to know when to hold em When to hold em
Know when to fold em When to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done
You got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when youre sittin at the table
Therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done
I dont want another heartbreak
I dont need another turn to cry no
I dont wanna learn the hard way
Baby hello
Oh no goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

Its the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its ah impossible
This kiss this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
How does love get so off course oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart
Soft touch fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby Im forever yours

Its the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its ah unthinkable
This kiss this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss this kiss

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside oh
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Lets let everything slide
You got me floating
You got me flying

Its the way you love me The way
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion Ahh ahh
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its ah subliminal
This kiss this kiss
Its criminal
This kiss this kiss
Its the way you love me baby The way you love me baby

This kiss this kiss
Its criminal
This kiss this kiss
Its the way you love me baby The way you love me baby
Its the way you love me darling yeah

Its the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her round the playground
Across the monkey bars to the merrygoround
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Now were grown up and shes my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Aint much changed I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together she still gets to me
Cant believe its been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no

Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said Ill love her til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa

The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

Ive never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I dont know how you do what you do
Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I dont know how you do what you do
Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by you


Every little thing that you do
Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
Oh girl
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh every little thing that you do
Every little thing that you do
Baby Im amazed by
By you
Well Ive heard those city singers singin bout how they can love
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I aint seen it all
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
Theres a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different and every ones the same
And this is just another way of sayin the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A Whippoorwill
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasnt ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didnt go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didnt go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love
A lot about living and a little about love
Yeahee
Thats right
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
Yeehah
Its me everybody howdy Lil Darkie with another Christian hit
Yuh

I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and its audible
I turn your gallon hat to some particles
Cant even read what they wrote in my articles
Im so illiterate
I cant even read a little bit
I keep a banjo my hip and I diddle it
Middle kid I got some siblings
Rat eat the scrap on the floor and the nibblings
I keep a bat I keep score in my back yard
My daddy fat and he poor it aint that hard
My dad republican but he live on unemployment
Farming dont bring no enjoyment
Kids in my town is afflicted with opiates
Heroin needles addiction is copious
Never appropriate uncle yelling bout the Soviets taking over his associates

Ima country boy in my heart
Ima country boy in these parts
Ima country boy on my land
Ima country boy I dont bend
Uh want some freedom Ill deliver
Uh out in Russia you might shiver
See the moonshine inside my liver
George shot Lenny by the river
Uh

Dipping tobacco inside of my lip again
Ripping the back off a pack and then stick it in
Spit it inside of a jar get my nicotine
Get the fuck outta my town man Im sick of them
Methamphetamine abusers
We the better men they losers
The beggers cannot be the choosers
I be posted with my crackers
Some of us blacker but that aint a factor
We packing that heat and its hotter than barbecue
Im with my dogs thats Scooby Doo Marmaduke
Put up a wall and I barb it too
That way it harming you
Hopping it thats what that karma do
I conceal carry my  special
Especially for any devilish vessels
My rifle dont trifle on who in its sights
If he evil my Deagle be taking his life
And that eagle I keep on my Jeep and my Chevy
It fill up my heart till a part of me heavy
The levies they creaking
The plains and the peaks
And the valleys from Georgia
To Cali Im seeking
For destiny manifest
Definitely can attest
I despise everyone
Anyones ran against
One reason or another
Whether northerner or southern
I prefer less stubbornness inside the governance
I want my vote to feel less like another miss
And like they thinking bout us normal citizens
I wonder if theres any time to fit us in
Too busy banning selfdefence
Everybodys tense
None of these liberals making any sense
Now theres some nazis that took up residence
Voted for Donald and Im still scared of pence
What the fuck is the whole country coming to
Rappers and Muslims is dying and gunning too
Police get shot and they doin the killing

Yippeekiyay motherfucker
Yuh yuh
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and its audible
I turn your gallon hat to some particles
Cant even read what they wrote in my
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didnt have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
Hes an outlaw loose and running
Came the whisper from each lip
And hes here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona ranger
Wouldnt be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didnt matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasnt long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didnt worry 
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twentyone would be the ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger
Was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the rangers aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have went on living
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron big iron
When he tried to match the ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh it sounds good to me I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh it sounds good to me
Yes it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh it sounds good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own dont fill up half
But dont you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

On a lonely highway stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
Youre right there in everything I do

Cause Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Its my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
Ill have everything Ill ever need
Im carrying your love with me
Im carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed
Carrying your love with me
Dont try to do this screw this break this disc and lose it
Whenever you hear this song just dont accuse it
I had a fit trashed my house and killed a blue tit
Went to the studio and had to cool it
This type of song you dont have to ever introduce it
You just know thats my new hit
These type of songs will causes a brain contusion
A mass profusion of dummies undisputed

I walk in Walmart gettin girls with utter charm YEAH
Urine in my crotch and smelling my underarms WHOO
Providing alibies as soon as I hear alarms UH OH
Paranoid chump thatll run from an Islam
Carter Run Nicks got a bomb
Strapped to his forehead screamin KAZAKHSTAN

The wolf never thinks instincts

Shootin blanks
Siphoning gas tanks cops see him a saint
Dagniabbit this dude I just provoked
Think hell finish me by slittin my throat
Reversed flipped him into the streets he got squashed Chief
Now back to this beef I had with a Girl Scout on State Street

Cheat on who you wanna cheat on get ya groupie swing on
Say Ching Chong in the hometown of Mao Zedong
Start a fight get drunk
Threaten the next White President with spunk Not in the eye
Write on the wall disobey the laws
Run through a schoolhouse in nothing but your drawers FREEDOM
Fans abroad theres nothin to applaud
But were joking its all fun the good is in us all
Dont try to do this

Go in a church and start a scuffle
And dont hesitate to punch the Deacon with swollen knuckles YEAH
We like that squash an Ant with combats
Scrape that crap back right in front of a toddler HA YOU SEE THAT

Or hypocrite who say these dumb hits but dont do it

Zombies cause you patent and copy what you all see
Some people misjudge me they dont know me
Theyll never flop me Im hardcore and Im cocky
I came to destroy these generations of babies
And parents who let their kids listen to me theyre crazy
Paraphrase me Im makin them so lazy
Thats how I got this whole fanbase to embrace me
A only did this so my career would prolong
I dedicate this to any kid in a strict home
A cripple a critic or any midget Im sicked on
A sick song to retaliate to and its called
I wish I had of known you when you were a little younger around me you might have learned a thing or two
If Id known you longer you might be a little stronger
Maybe youd shoot straighter than you do maybe youd shoot straighter than you do

As he walked into the poolroom you could tell he didnt fit
In his hand made boots custom suit pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight thered be a showdown then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy about to lose his cool
But the Barons hands were steady as the two began to duel
Yeah he was like a General on a battlefield of slate
And he would say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight hed say


Now Billy Joe was busted but he hadnt felt the sting
And from the far end of the table he threw his Mothers wedding ring
And he said You won my money but it isnt going to do the trick
Ill bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick
The Barons eyes grew foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he was hit below the belt
Twenty years ago it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didnt know before he left that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder when the Baron shot the break
But it grew quickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hand that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said
Oh how you sparkle
And oh how you shine
That flush on your cheeks is more than the wine
And he must do something that I didnt do
Whatever hes doing
It looks good on you

You look so good in love
You want him
Thats easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

He must have stolen some stars from the sky
And gave them to you to wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder why I couldnt see


Darling Ive wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you away
Please let me say


You look so good in love

Said I was in my early s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days lookin at the xrays
Talkin bout the options and talkin bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
Hows it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

I went sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasnt
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin fishing
Wasnt such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what Id do
If I could do it all again
And then

I went sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

Like tomorrow was a gift and youve got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it what can
I do with with it what would I do with it

Sky divin
I went Rocky Mountain climbin
I went  seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
To live like you were dyin
Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
Theyd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes
And way down south in the Everglades
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass sways
The eagles fly and the otters play
In the land of the Seminole

So blow blow Seminole wind
Blow like youre never gonna blow again
Im calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar

Progress came and took its toll
And in the name of flood control
They made their plans and they drained the land
Now the glades are going dry
And the last time I walked in the swamp
I sat upon a Cypress stump
I listened close and I heard the ghost
Of Osceola cry
The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
Thats when she walked in
I said Im sorry but were closed
And she said I know
But Im afraid I left my purse
I said I put one back behind the bar
I bet its probably yours
And the next thing that I knew
There we were lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said Youll only get this back on one condition

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evening
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said This is the last thing I expected
And then she took me by the hand
And said Ill only marry you on one condition


Like no one else had ever danced before
I cant explain what happened on that floor
But the music played
We held each other close
And we danced
Yeah we danced

The judgement appealed from should be affirmed with costs

Sometimes its hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
Youll have bad times
And hell have good times
Doin things that you dont understand
But if you love him
Youll forgive him
Even though hes hard to understand
And if you love him
Oh be proud of him
Cause after all hes just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man
Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man
On the road again
I just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin places that Ive never been
Seein things that I may never see again
And I cant wait to get on the road again
Here we go on the road again
Like a band of Gypsies we go down the highway
Were the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin our way
And our way is on the road again
I just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again break free
And I cant wait to get on the road again
If I could grant
You one wish
Id wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh I love watching you baby
When youre driving me crazy

Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me
Theres nowhere else Id rather be Drives me wild
Ooh to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me Love me

Someday Ill find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you

Ooh to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me Love me

Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis and stationed them alongside those of the Athenians
Euphemus son of Troezenus the son of Ceos was captain of the Ciconian spearsmen
Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant Alybe where there are mines of silver
Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land by the eddying waters of the Xanthus
That lonesome Texas sun was setting slow
And in the rearview mirror
I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment
Im still there

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

Another town
Another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely praying before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

For every heart you break
You pay a price
But I cant forget the tears in her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Did I wait too long
How can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

Last night I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it til four
I read some old love letters right up til the break of dawn
Yeah Ive been settin alone diggin up bones

Then I went to the jewelery and I found our wedding rings
Ive put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah tonight Im settin alone diggin up bones

Im diggin up bones Im diggin up bones
Exhumin things thats better left alone
Im resurrectin memories of a love thats dead and gone
Yeah tonight Im settin alone diggin up bones

And I went to the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah tonight Im settin alone diggin up bones

Exhumin things thats better left alone
Im resurrectin memories of a love thats dead and gone
Yeah tonight Im settln alone diggin up bones

Belly split four ways
Yak money spend it all in four days
Im just tryna stack money why they wanna act funny
I dont wanna let it go in broad day
I got busy for that Lizzy fam I saw cake
You can get it in the press or get it all flake
Me and Jason took a chase down Mortlake
Dem boy food dead my foods gormet
Came for a th but he bought four ths
Licked him in the E class Endo and my North Face
True what they say though more money more snakes
Long time long time I aint seen your face
Rebound ima catch you like a cold
Couple ygs goin atchu like a cold
Jumped out the rangy swagger 
Snakes in the grass had to go grab Tracey
They keep talking all this gossip bout me
Like theres anything less than real bosses round me
We all about this paper
Im in the trap with some cling and some razor
And you know I keep that white girl call me Fazer
Trappin s and I dont really know when ima sleep again
I aint tryna dead beef fam I got beef to dead
This aint no corny rap this for the morning trap
This for them young youts I aint tryna slump goons
This for the one who pebble grinds on his peddle bike and he dont care what the rarseclart weathers like
This for them goons on the wing who never snitched stayed real and took a few on the chin
Cause ive been there done that
Rid there dumped that
Pitched there slung crack
Jakes in my mums flat
Warrents for a firearm but I said it werent me officer that day I had a tired arm
From all the hand to hands
Out in cunchside Green white B all ringing off the one line
And I dont even need punchlines but I gotta rap these days to get it off my chest sometimes
Ive  been crud since a benz was a 
And now you wanna act like I aint ever done mine
Like I aint ever rolled out n put in some knife work
I promise you your lifes worth less than what the lights worth
Fam I know some wild cats known them from a while back
Hand it on ride it they dont even get high first
My lifestyles kinda hectic
The preacher man says its the end of time
And the Mississippi River shes agoin dry
The interest is up and the stock markets down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun a rifle and a wheel drive
And a country boy can survive country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Aint too many things these old boys cant do
We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive country folks can survive

Because you cant starve us out and you cant make us run
Cause were them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Maam
If you aint into that we dont give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name just hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And Id send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For  dollars my friend lost his life
Id love to spit some BeechNut in that dudes eyes and shoot him with my old 
Cause a country boy can survive country folks can survive

Cause you cant starve us out and you cant make us run
Cause were them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Maam
And if you aint into that we dont give a damn

Were from north California and south Alabam
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck and run a trotline
And a country boy can survive country folks can survive

A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
Song Song of the south
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth

But we were so poor that we couldnt tell

Well I left Kentucky back in 
An went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day Id watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes Id hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
Id sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured Id have it all by the time I retired
Id have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

Id get it one piece at a time
And it wouldnt cost me a dime
Youll know its me when I come through your town
Im going to ride around in style
Im going to drive everybody wild
Because Ill have the only one there is a round

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldnt miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts an bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snacked  out in my buddys mobile home
Now up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And thats when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a 
And the motor turned out to be a 
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an Adaptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlight was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well thats when we noticed that we only had one tailfin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said Honey take me for a spin
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didnt laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds

Id get it one piece at a time
And it wouldnt cost me a dime
Youll know its me when I come through your town
Im going to ride around in style
Im going to drive everybody wild
Because Ill have the only one there is a round

Ugh Yow RED RYDER
This is the COTTON MOUTH
In the PSYCHOBILLY CADILLAC Come on
Huh This is the COTTON MOUTH
And nugatory on the cost of this mowchine there RED RYDER
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up its cheaper that way
Ugh what model is it
Well Its a        
   automobile
Its a        
   automobile
Ive been down to Mississippi
Down through New Orleans
Yes I have
Ive played in California
There aint too much I havent seen
No there aint
Lord Im a ramblin man
Dont fool around with a ramblin man
Left a girl in West Virginia
Up there where that green grass grows
Yes I did
Got a girl in Cincinatti
Waitin where the Ohio River flows
Oh girl
Im a ramblin man
Dont give your heart to a ramblin man
You better move away
Youre standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little  heart wont be the same
But Im a ramblin man
Dont mess around with and ol ramblin man
You better not
Well up in Chicago
I was known as quite a boy
Yes I was
Down in Alabama
They call me the man of joy
Still do
Well Im a ramblin man
Dont fall in love with a ramblin man
You better move away
Youre standing to close to the flame
Once I mess with the ol mind
Your little ol heart wont be the same
Oh Im a ramblin man
Dont mess around with any ol ramblin man
This mornin I got up at 
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree Ive seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
Its a beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my tshirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like Id lost my mind
I said Baby I love you cant live without you I know I dont say it enough

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your hearts poundin out of your chest
Sometimes its just beatin
Some days you just forget
What all youve been given
Some days you just get by
And some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Like you never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missing
Some days youre living
Ita beautiful world sometimes I dont see so clear

Some days you start singin
And you dont need a reason
Sometimes the worlds just right
Your clear eyes aint even blinkin
Got a heart full of grateful
For all youve been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days youre just alive
Some days youre livin
Some days youre livin

Livin like youll never die
Blues a little bluer up in the sky
Youre highs a little high
You feel that fire youve been missin
Some days youre living
Some days youre living
I choose to be apathetic
Much rather than misanthropic
Im fucking crazy no stop it
Ill put your face in my pocket
Rock it every other day
Shit cray see they gon cop it
Im far from crazy cause they still see me mock it
Drop six at a time
Demonic shit when I rhyme
Take time to quit realign
Yall on a different design than Im
But it really doesnt matter
I dont care for chitter chatter
Im a finger licking batter
Pitter patter get a ladder
Kids sicker get sadder
Get with her get at her
You miss her get madder
Half a track
Every flow different so get off my back
Sick to submission my mission is act
That
Is why every song gray
Working and working and working all day
Its for this which they pray
Grant your wishes okay
Ill spit shit if you say
I wont flaunt my fillet
Scrap meat
Keep swerving in the back seat
Wild fire they attract heat
Play with your mind like your Mac skeet
All in the keys
Straight to the top I just followed the breeze
Far as he sees sight of the mind
I aint got time for no ease
See I make it a challenge
These hieroglyphics be wicked
Stick in your brain and then balance
Ive got so many a talons
Salads soft drinks and then ballads
Im talentless when it comes to this
Im the prince of the palace
Alice been wonderin
Where the fuck Ive been
On a nother sinful journey
Under them
Can you comprehend
What the fuck I speak
Please explain it to me Im stuck up creek so
Let that shit flow
Only thing upon my mind is the doe
Ha ha ha no
That was a joke
All I do blow grow and fuck ho
Only thing upon my mind is the doe
Ha ha ha no
That was a joke
All I do blow grow and fuck ho
All I do blow grow and fuck ho
Didnt forget no apostrophe
Its possibly the part of me
Posted up on your property
Popping pills uncooperatively
Lifes like Monopoly
Bipabippity boppity
Give me digits and lock the D
Or
Drop the beat from way up top to the floor
Score
Balling too hard and Im falling towards
Your
Joke ass descriptions of rappers on tour
Hoping and wishing theyre shit will implore
Grimy ass beeches to sit on their shore
Sure a whores gardens impeccable
And these vegetables delectable
This a mic check my text a full
Assortment of important information all contextual
Detectable if youre well read and could wreck the bull
Effective elicitation
Sick of waiting
Patient with my solicitation
Inner station
Innovation
Into that Im interlacing
Scintillation ventilation
Integration and ovations
And occasionally
Some wicked bass mister hits is making
Breaking out in handcuffs
Living recklessly
I wreck the beat
Resurrected he
Perfected the
Trajectory
Erected A
Had sex with B
Elected C
Then protected me
Effectively
Respectably
Incessantly
I fuck equity
It was seven hundred fence posts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was raining sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
There aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Its been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree you ought to see it now
Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
That if we dont see eye to eye theres something we can do

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
There aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Babe I love the way we work it out
Thats what love is all about

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle

Id start walking your way youd start walking mine
Wed meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
Wed gain a lot of ground if wed both give a little
Aint no road too long when we meet in the middle
Tumble outta bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin and stretchin and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin
With folks like me on the job from  to 

Working  to 
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin by
Its all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
Its enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

 to  for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss wont seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
Youre just a step
On the boss mans ladder
But you got dreams hell never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tides gonna turn
An its all gonna roll you away

Working  to 
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin by
Its all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
Its enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

Theres a better life
And you think about it dont you
Its a rich mans game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

This truck needs a half tank

This radio needs three songs to play

Friday nights need to do

Knockin boots
Suck on your own thumb
The night is still young
Im churning and Im turning
Just trying to hold on
To a dream that once was
A ringing soft buzz
Trickle in through my window
And leaving with no cause
The absent melodies when you walked out that door
The white walls burst in I couldnt feel any more
I wept a waterfall waiting for your return
By the time that you did
I dried up and I burned
I burned
Whoa hey
I burned
Oh oh

I wanna shout at the top of my lungs
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Ive had enough
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Im getting rough now
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
High high
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
I wanna shout at the top of my lungs
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Ive had enough
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Im getting rough now
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
High high

Burn like a wildfire
Crisp and unclear
Cotton and stripped clean
Just leaving me here
Crumpled in touch
My heart turned to black
I nursed it and I cared for it
Im not looking back

Im moving on from desire from loving all its potions
Im mixed open lost stuck in my devotion
Working til Im turning blue with all my songs in my mind
Choking on all my words and closing in on all my dirt

I wanna shout at the top of my lungs
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Ive had enough
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Im getting rough now
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
High high
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
I wanna shout at the top of my lungs
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
At the top of my lungs oh how many nights
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Im getting rough now
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Im getting rough right now
Im getting rough right now
Im getting rough right now
Oh eh oh
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Im glowing
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Im giving it
Are we doing it right Going and going and going
Im going
Burning so bright giving it giving it giving it
Oh oh
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddys daddy before him
Brought up working on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if youre lucky
For a small town Southern man

First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy he wasnt planned
Seven people living all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understanding
From a small town Southern man

And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man

Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you cant break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man

And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man

Finally death came calling
For this small town Southern man
He said its alright cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Dont you cry and dont you worry
Im blessed and I know I am
Cause God has a place in Heaven
For the small town Southern man

And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man

Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And Im tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized youre all I ever wanted
And its killin me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so oh I told you so
I told you some day youd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that oldtime feelin would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that youve missed me too and that youve been so lonely
And youve waited for the day that I returned
And wed live and love forever and that Im your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
Would you say

I told you so oh I told you so
I told you some day youd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Now Ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me all night long
So many lovers games Id love to play with you
On that hand theres no reason why its wrong

But on the other hand theres a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your lovin man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passions I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips I felt so alive
Ive got to hand it to you girl youre somethin else

But on the other hand theres a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your lovin man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

Yeah the reason I must go is on the other hand
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought aw shell be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall an said

That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said give it away
Just give it away
And I said now honey dont you even want
Your half of everything
She said give it away
Just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away


So Im still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She dont care about anymore
Mmm like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where all our love was made
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away

Ive got a furnished house a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I cant even give it away
First I get cold then hot
Think Im on fire
But Im not
Oh what a pain Ive got
It must be love
Theres nothin I can do
All that I want is you
Look what Im goin through
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
Ive been dreamin of
Oh what a feelin
It must be love
Somethin is wrong
Alright
I think of you all night
Cant sleep till mornin light
It must be love
Seein you in my dreams
Feelin you close to me
Oh what eles can it be
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
Ive been dreamin of
Oh what a feelin
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
Ive been dreamin of
Oh what a feelin
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
Ive been dreamin of
Oh what a feelin
It must be love
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot
She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought Id walk on in and Id give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot
I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been Its been a while
She was glad to see me I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldnt die
Looking at her now I cant believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said its not too late to start again
We could spend the night together take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot
But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes Im in need of something but something you aint got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldnt die
Looking at her now I cant believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there Ive never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
Last updated  PM MST
An old cowboy went riding out
One dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of redeyed cows he saw
A Plowing through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy drawl

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
Hes riding hard to catch that herd
But he aint caught em yet
Because theyve got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him
As He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
From Riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devils herd
Across these endless skies

Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippieyiaie Yippieyioh
The Ghost Riders in the sky
Dont call my name out your window Im leaving
I wont even turn my head
Dont send your kinfolk to give me no talking
Ill be gone like I said
Youd just say the same old things
That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till Im gone
Dont give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
Im tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man
Now you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I aint taking nothing thatll slow down my traveling
While Im untangling my mind
I aint going to repeat what i said anymore
While Im breathing air that aint been breathed before
Ill be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then youll understand your man
Meditate on it
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man
I woke up cryin late at night when I was very young
I had dreamed my father had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him I couldnt lie there anymore
So I made my way down the mirrored hall and tapped upon his door

And I said Daddy Im so afraid
How would I go on with you gone that way
Dont wanna cry anymore so may I stay with you
And he said Thats my job thats what I do
Everything I do is because of you to keep you safe with me
Thats my job you see

Later we barely got along this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning I wanted to fly out west
I said I could make it out there if I just had the fare
I got half will you loan me the rest

And I said Daddy Im so afraid
Theres no guarantee in the plans Ive made
And if I should fail who will pay my way back home
And he said Thats my job thats what I do
Everything I do is because of you to keep you safe with me
Thats my job you see

Every person carves his spot and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might light as bright as he

Woke up early one bright fall day read the tragic news
After all my travels I settled down within a mile or two
I make my livin with words and rhymes and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead as bits of poetry

But I say Daddy Im so afraid
How will I go on with you gone this way
How can I come up with a song to say I love you
Thats my job thats what I do
Everything I do is because of you to keep you safe with me
Thats my job you see

Everything I do is because of you to keep you safe with me
As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see
Darling dont say a word Ive already heard
What your body is saying to mine
Youre tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
 Instrumental 
On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey were drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darling dont say a word Ive already heard
What your body is saying to mine
If you want all night you know its alright
Ive got time
Youve got a man with a slow hand
Youve got a lover with an easy touch
Youve got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
Youve got somebody
Who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
Well I say friend dont take her shes all Ive got
Please dont take her love away from me
Im beggin you friend dont take her shes all Ive got
Shes everything in life Ill ever need
She is life when I wanna live
Shes everything to me in life that life can give
Shes my water when I need to drink
Shes the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
Let me tell you now friend
Shes my fingers when I want to feel
Shes the only thing in life to me thats really real
She is love shes all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make the flower grow
Let me tell you now friend
I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But theres a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people thats all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
Wed get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it wont be long
Ill rejoin them in a song
Im going to join the family circle at the throne
No the circle wont be broken
By and by Lord by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky Lord in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But Ill rejoin him in a song
Well be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky Lord in the sky
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky Lord in the sky
Songwriter  Carl Perkins
I told you Id leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took your every word to heart
Cause I cant stand us bein apart
And just to show how much I really miss you

Every light in the house is on
The backyards bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
Its kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein gone
Every light in the house is on

If I should ever start forgettin
Ill turn the lights off one by one
So you can see that I agree its over
But until then I want you to know
If you look south youll see a glow
Thats me waitin at home each night to hold ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyards bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
Its kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein gone

Oh every light in the house is on
The backyards bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
Its kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein gone
Every light in the house is on
I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
Ive had a change of dreams
Im coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
Ill keep on searching
I cant go on hurting this way
Shes somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
Ive got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn


I cant blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
Ill find her no matter what it takes
If you leave me I wont miss you
And I wont ever take you back
Girl your memory wont ever haunt me
Cause I dont love you and now if youll buy that

I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free

I dont worship the ground you walk on
I never have and thats a fact
I wont follow or try to find you
Cause I dont love you and now if youll buy that


Yeah if youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free
If you really want to know
She comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K is her favorite song
If you play it you might have a chance
Tonight shes only sippin white wine
Shes friendly and fun lovin
Most of the time
But dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Heres a glass of chablis some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she wont need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her hearts on the mend
So if you ever come back to see her again
Dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
But dont ask her on a straight tequila night
Shell start thinkin about him and shes ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
I keep hearing youre concerned about my happiness
But all the thought youre giving me is conscience I guess
If I were walking in your shoes I wouldnt worry none
While you and your friends are worrying bout me
Im having lots of fun

Counting flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playing solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me Ive nothing to do

Last night I dressed in tails pretending I was on the town
As long as I can dream its hard to slow this swinger down
So please dont give a thought to me Im really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Counting flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playing solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me Ive nothing to do

Its good to see you I must go I know I look a fright
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Counting flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all
Playing solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now dont tell me Ive nothing to do

Dont tell me Ive nothing to do
Dont tell me Ive nothing to do

Amarillo by morning Amarillos where Ill be
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosas Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosas I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everythings gone in life nothing is left
Its been so long since Ive seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothings worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosas Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I cant let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosas back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
Im getting weary unable to ride

But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where Ive fallen
Though I am weary I cant stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that Ill die for
One little kiss and Feleena goodbye
Songwriter  Marty Robbins
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin light

Awaiting in the front yard sitting on a log
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog
Yonder come my kinfolk in the moonlight

Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin light

Belly full of beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light

When your kinfolk leave and the kids get fed
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights

Well my names John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year
Hed buy a hundred pound of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
Its before my time but Ive been told
He never came back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Masons Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin sound
Then the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin knew something wasnt right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin down Copperhead Road

I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
And I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
And now the DEAs got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like Im back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie dont you know
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

Copperhead Road
Copperhead Road
Copperhead Road
Cant concentrate on the preacher preaching
My attention span done turned off
Im honed in on that angel singing
Up there in the choir loft

Shes got her daddys money her mamas good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination a college education
Add it all up its a deadly combination
Shes a good bass fisher a dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
Shes got her daddys money her mamas good looks
And look whos lookin at me

Her second cousin was my third grade teacher
I used to cut her grandmas grass
Back then she was nothin but knees and elbows
Golly did she grow up fast


Lord if you got any miracles handy
Maybe you could grant me one
Just let me walk down the aisle and say I do
To that angel with a choir robe on


Shes got her daddys money her mamas good looks
And shes lookin at me
Step right up come on in
If youd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where shed bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper Oh I love you
But now shes gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead thats the bed
Where we lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Dont it look like shed be able
Just to touch me and say Good morning dear

Theres her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart
As you leave youll see the nursery
Oh she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Step right up come on in
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies In Southern sky
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin willows would cry for joy joy

Feels so good
Feels so good its frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
Ladadadada ladadadadada dadadadadada dadada dadada

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good its a frightening
Wish I could Southern nights
Stop this world from the fighting
Dadadadada dadadadadada dadadadadada dadada dadadada dadadadadada

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed
When I was a child
Down in south Caroline
Soons the Saturday sun went on down
My folks and sister would go
And leave me home all alone
Goin to that big square dance in town
Well my old radio
Would play that ol Opry show
So I never got lonesome or blue
Id fall asleep in my chair
And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through
When my folks would come home
Theyd be humming a song
Mammad smile and say Child dont you know
There aint a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl
Like the San Antonio stroll
Well the day finally come
When my momma said Hon
Its bout time you came with us as well
Well I had me a time
Yes I danced all night
Till they rang that old cracked midnight bell
Then the lights went down low
The fiddler picked up his bow
And he played something stately and slow
And my sister Eileen and her husband to be
They held hands and began to stroll
Ive been away for a while
But it still brings a smile
When I think of the way that it goes
Now Ill sing it to you
Just so we both can do
That ol San Antonio stroll
Now Ill sing it to you
Just so well all can do
That ol San Antonio stroll
Oh Alabama
The devil fools
With the best laid plan
Swing low Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now the moment
Is all that it meant

Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
Thats breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows down in Alabama
See the old folks
Tied in white robes
Hear the banjo
Dont it take you down home


Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
Thats breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand
Make friends down in Alabama
Im from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing Alabama
You got the rest of the Union
To help you along
Whats going wrong

Mommas burning chicken for the Tupperware party tonight
Daddys asleep in his chair the TVs blaring the stats for Halftime

Theres a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying Will work for food
You know the man you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to
You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean
What if hes an angel sent here from Heaven
And hes making certain that youre doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if hes an angel
Theres a man and theres a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
Theres a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it dont sound like harmony
You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye
What if shes an angel sent here from Heaven
And shes making certain that youre doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if shes an angel
A little girl on daddys lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddys shoes
Maybe shes an angel sent here from Heaven
And shes making certain that youre doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if shes an angel
Girl I know I dont know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
Im so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is its going good

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know that the rising sun
Aint no good for me
Cause youll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 
Theres plenty of gas and the nights still alive

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought hed stop
At Webs and have him a drink fore he went home to her
Andy WoLo said hello
He said Hi whats new
And Wo said Sit down I got some bad news thats going to hurt

Said Im your best friend and you know thats right
But your young bride isnt home tonight
Since youve been gone shes been seeing that Amos boy Seth
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said Boy dont you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth Ive been with her myself

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Andy got scared and left the bar
Andy didnt have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

He went off to Andys house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
Whyd you do it

The judge said guilty on a makebelieve trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said suppers waiting at home and I got to get to it

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Well they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andys house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
Thats one body thatll never be found
You see little sister doesnt miss when she aims her gun

Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands
Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia
Thats the night that they hung an innocent man
Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands

Maybe its time we got back to the basics of love
Lets go to Luckenbach Texas

Between Hank Williams pain songs and
Newburys train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach Texas aint nobody feelin no pain
So baby lets sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day
Weve been so busy keepin up with the Jones
Four car garage and were still building on

I knew a man called him Sandy Cane
Few folks even knew his name
But a hero yes was he
He left a boy came back a man
Still many just dont understand
About the reasons we are free
I cant forget the look in his eyes
Or the tears he cried
As he said these words to me

All gave some and some gave all
Some stood through for the red white and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me think of all your liberties
And recall some gave all

Now Sandy Cane is no longer here
But his words are oh so clear
As they echo throughout our land
For all his friends who gave us all
Who stood the ground and took the fall
To help their fellow man
Love your country live with pride
And dont forget those who died
America cant you see

All gave some and some gave all
Some stood through for the red white and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me think of all your liberties
And recall some gave all
And if you ever think of me think of all your liberties
And recall yes recall
Some gave all some gave all
I sure do hope this is a long night
Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes Im falling
A little more and more
Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch theyre burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
Well fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets well be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day
Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss
Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Im in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why

I rush and rush until lifes no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But Im in a hurry and dont know why
I was drivin through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

Well I wasnt in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl

When the band started playin the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin that you aint never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go
She dipped down spun around and docedoed

She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl

If your ever down in Georgia around about July
If you aint in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that youre goin have a ball
Learnin how to do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl
Yeah do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
Do the watermelon crawl
Its that feeling
That someone
Is standing behind me
And I turn around and theres no one there

And its the sensation
That someone
Just whispered
I still hear your voice but youre not really here

Your memory is like a ghost
And my heart is its host

I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
Ill find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
Theres a place youve touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you

You said youd love me
Forever
Then you said
Its over
And left me without the missing link

I thought Id
Forget you
But I guess I
Forgot to
And lately Ive been too confused to think

When I reach for someone new
Its like Im touching you

I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
Ill find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
Theres a place youve touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you

In everything that moves
And everything I do

I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
Ill find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
Theres a place youve touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you

Ohhhhhh I can still feel you still feel you
Yeah
Theres a reason for the sunshining sky
And theres a reason
Why Im feeling so high
Must be the season when that
Love light shines all around us
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love cant hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean
Its the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason
Theres a reason for the warm sweet nights
And theres a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those
Love lights shine all around us
So let that wonder
Take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder
As it warms your face
You cant hold back
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean
Its the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And youll know what I mean
Its the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And youll know what I mean
Thats the reason
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in with feathers on his head
Mamas in her room learnin how to sew
Daddys drinkin beer listenin to the radio

Hank Williams sings KawLiga and Dear John
And time marches on time marches on

Sisters using rouge and clear complection soap
Brothers wearin beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed barely makes a sound
Daddys got a girlfriend in another town

Bob Dylan sings Like a Rolling Stone
And time marches on time marches on

The South moves north the North moves south
A star is born a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes everything changes

Sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brothers on a diet for high cholesterol
Mamas out of touch with reality
Daddys in the ground beneath the maple tree

As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on time marches on
Time marches on time marches on
Time marches on time marches on
Mill worker houses lined up in a row
Another southern Sundays morning glow
Beneath the steeple all the people have begun
Shaking hands with the man who grips the gospel gun

While the quiet prayer the smell of dinner on the ground
Heals up the morning air aint nothing sweeter around
I can almost hear my Momma praying
Oh Lord forgive us when we doubt another sacred Sunday in the south oh

A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
Popping in the wind like an angry cannon ball
Now the holes of history are cold and still
But they still smell the powder burning and they probably always will

And on the old town square under the barber shop pole
They sat me up in the chair when I was four years old
I can almost hear my Poppa saying Wont you hold still son stop squirming around
Another southern Sundays coming down

I can almost hear the old folks say
Youll make it big one day
Youll leave this town
Some other lazy Sunday
Youll come back around

I can feel the evening sun go down
And all the lights in the houses one by one go out
Softly in the distance nothing stirs about
And the night is filled with the sound of a whippoorwill
On a Sunday in the south alright

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday in the south
Oh another sacred Sunday in the south
Just another Sunday
How I missed those old sweet Sundays in the south
Another sacred Sunday
I can hear my Momma calling
The south alright
Just another Sunday oh oh oh
I came crawling home last night like many nights before
I finally made it to my feet as she opened up the door
And she said Youre not gonna do this anymore
She said Im gonna hire a wino to decorate our home
So youll feel more at ease here and you wont have to roam
Well take out the dining room table and put a bar along that wall
And a neon sign to point the way to our bathroom down the hall
She said Just bring your Friday paycheck and Ill cash them all right here
And for you Ill always keep in stock those soft aluminum cans
And when youre feeling macho you can crush them like a man
She said Well rip out all the carpet and put sawdust on the floor
Serve hard boiled eggs and pretzels and I wont cook no more
Therell be Monday night football on TV above the bar
And a pay phone in the hallway when your friends cant find their car
She said Im gonna hire a wino to decorate our home
So youll feel more at ease here and you wont need to roam
Well take out the dining room table and put a bar along that wall
And a neon sign to point the way to our bathroom down the hall
She said Youll get friendly service and for added atmosphere
Ill slip on something sexy and Ill cut it clear to here
Then you can slap my bottom every time you tell a joke
Just as long as you keep tipping well Ill laugh until youre broke
She said Instead of family quarrels well have a barroom brawl
When the Hams bear says its closing time you wont have far to crawl
And when you run out of money youll have me to thank
You can sleep it off next morning when Im putting it in the bank
She said Im gonna hire a wino to decorate our home
So you can feel more at ease here and you wont have to roam
When you and your friends get off from work and have a powerful thirst
There wont be any reason why you cant stop off here first
She said Im gonna hire a wino to decorate our home
So youll feel more at ease here and you wont have to roam
Well take out the dining room table and put a bar along that wall
And a neon sign to point the way to our bathroom down the hall

 CHAMIZAL ARBITRATION NOT SATISFACTORY
 LATIN AMERICA
 VENEZUELA
 MEXICO 
It seems my duty as Commander in Chief to place troops in
sufficient number where if Congress shall direct that they
enter Mexico to save American lives and property an effective
movement may be promptly made Meantime the movement
of the troops to Texas and elsewhere near the boundary
accompanied with sincere assurances of the utmost goodwill
toward the present Mexican Government and with larger and
more frequent patrols along the border to prevent insurrectionary
expeditions from American soil will hold up the hands of the
existing Government and will have a healthy moral effect to prevent
attacks upon Americans and their property in any subsequent
general internecine strife Again the sudden mobilization of a division
of troops has been a great test of our Army and full of useful
instruction while the maneuvers that are thus made possible can
occupy the troops and their officers to great advantage
The assumption by the press that I contemplate intervention on
Mexican soil to protect American lives or property is of course
gratuitous because I seriously doubt whether I have such authority
under any circumstances and if I had I would not exercise it without
express congressional approval Indeed as you know I have already
declined without Mexican consent to order a troop of Cavalry to
protect the breakwater we are constructing just across the border
in Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado River to save the Imperial
Valley although the insurrectos had scattered the Mexican troops
and were taking our horses and supplies and frightening our workmen
away My determined purpose however is to be in a position so that
when danger to American lives and property in Mexico threatens and
the existing Government is rendered helpless by the insurrection I can
promptly execute congressional orders to protect them with effect
Meantime I send you this letter through the Secretary to call your
attention to some things in connection with the presence of the division
in the Southwest which have doubtless occurred to you but which I wish
to emphasize
In the first place I want to make the mobilization a firstclass training
for the Army and I wish you would give your time and that of the War
College to advising and carrying out maneuvers of a useful character
and plan to continue to do this during the next three months By that
time we may expect that either Ambassador Wilsons fears will have
been realized and chaos and its consequences have ensued or that
the present Government of Mexico will have so readjusted matters as
to secure tranquillitya result devoutly to be wished The troops can
then be returned to their posts I understood from you in Washington
that Gen Aleshire said that you could probably meet all the additional
expense of this whole movement out of the present appropriations if
the troops continue in Texas for three months I sincerely hope this is so
I observe from the newspapers that you have no blank cartridges but I
presume that this is an error or that it will be easy to procure those for
use as soon as your maneuvers begin
Second Texas is a State ordinarily peaceful but you can not put 
troops into it without running some risk of a collision between the people
of that State and especially the Mexicans who live in Texas near the
border and who sympathize with the insurrectos and the Federal soldiers
For that reason I beg you to be as careful as you can to prevent friction of
any kind We were able in Cuba with the army of pacification there of
something more than  troops to maintain them for a year without
any trouble and I hope you can do the same thing in Texas Please give
your attention to this and advise all the officers in command of the
necessity for very great circumspection in this regard
Third One of the great troubles in the concentration of troops is the
danger of disease and I suppose that you have adopted the most
modern methods for preventing and if necessary for stamping out
epidemics That is so much a part of a campaign that it hardly seems
necessary for me to call attention to it
Finally I wish you to examine the question of the patrol of the border
and put as many troops on that work as is practicable and more than
are now engaged in it in order to prevent the use of our borderland for
the carrying out of the insurrection I have given assurances to the
Mexican ambassador on this point
I sincerely hope that this experience will always be remembered by the
Army and Navy as a useful means of education and I should be greatly
disappointed if it resulted in any injury or disaster to our forces from
any cause I have taken a good deal of responsibility in ordering this
mobilization but I am ready to answer for it if only you and those under
you use the utmost care to avoid the difficulties which I have pointed out
You may have a copy of this letter made and left with Gen Carter and
such other generals in command as you may think wise and necessary
to guide them in their course but to be regarded as confidential
The continuing gravity of the situation here and the chaos
that would ensue should the constitutional authorities be
eventually overthrown thus greatly increasing the danger
to which American lives and property are already subject
confirm the wisdom of the President in taking those military
precautions which making every allowance for the dignity
and the sovereignty of a friendly state are due to our nationals
abroad
Charged as I am with the responsibility of safeguarding these
lives and property I am bound to say to the department that
our military dispositions on the frontier have produced an
effective impression on the Mexican mind and may at any moment
prove to be the only guaranties for the safety of our nationals and
their property If it should eventuate that conditions here require
more active measures by the President and Congress sporadic
attacks might be made upon the lives and property of our nationals
but the ultimate result would be order and adequate protection
As a result of todays fighting across the international line
but within gunshot range of the heart of Douglas five
Americans wounded on this side of the line Everything points
to repetition of these casualties on tomorrow and while the
Federals seem disposed to keep their agreement not to fire
into Douglas the position of the insurrectionists is such that when
fighting occurs on the east and southeast of the intrenchments
people living in Douglas are put in danger of their lives In my
judgment radical measures are needed to protect our innocent
people and if anything can be done to stop the fighting at Agua
Prieta the ittiation calls for such action It is impossible to
safeguard the people of Douglas unless the town be vacated
Can anything be done to relieve situation now acute
Your dispatch received Have made urgent demand upon
Mexican Government to issue instructions to prevent firing
across border by Mexican federal troops and am waiting reply
Meantime I have sent direct warning to the Mexican and
insurgent forces near Douglas I infer from your dispatch that
both parties attempt to heed the warning but that in the strain
and exigency of the contest wild bullets still find their way into
Douglas The situation might justify me in ordering our troops to
cross the border and attempt to stop the fighting or to fire upon
both combatants from the American side But if I take this step I
must face the possibility of resistance and greater bloodshed and
also the danger of having our motives misconstrued and
misrepresented and of thus inflaming Mexican popular indignation
against many thousand Americans now in Mexico and jeopardizing
their lives and property The pressure for general intervention under
such conditions it might not be practicable to resist It is impossible
to foresee or reckon the consequences of such a course and we must
use the greatest selfrestraint to avoid it Pending my urgent
representation to the Mexican Government I can not therefore order
the troops at Douglas to cross the border but I must ask you and the
local authorities in case the same danger recurs to direct the people
of Douglas to place themselves where bullets can not reach them and
thus avoid casualty I am loath to endanger Americans in Mexico where
they are necessarily exposed by taking a radical step to prevent injury to
Americans on our side of the border who can avoid it by a temporary
inconvenience
 I am glad to say that no further invasion of American rights of any substantial character occurred
 The record of this Government in respect of the recognition of constituted authority in Mexico therefore is clear

My baby makes me proud
Lord dont she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin all over me in a crowd
Cause people like to talk
Lord dont they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know shell be leavin with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that Im a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord dont she make me smile
Shes never far away
Or too tired to say I want you
Shes always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
Shes still a baby to me
Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad Im a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Jennings
It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
She was lovely she was the queen of our nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
The secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire and out of control
There was nothin left to burn and nothin left to prove
Cash
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didnt know now what I didnt know then
All
Against the wind
We were runnin against the wind
We were young and strong
But just runnin against the wind
Nelson
The years rolled slowly past
I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin to run and runnin to live
Never worryin about payin or how much I owed
Movin eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin all the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin
Searchin for shelter again and again
All
Against the wind
We were runnin against the wind
I found myself seekin shelter against the wind
Nelson
All those drifters days are past me now
Ive got so much more to think about
Cash
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in what to leave out
All
Against the wind
We were runnin against the wind
We found ourselves seekin shelter against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Well I guess it was back in 
When eatin my cookin got the better of me
So I asked this little girl I was goin with to be my wife
Well she said she would
So I said I do
But Ida said I wouldnt
If Ida just knew how sayin I do
Was gonna screw up all of my life
Well the first few years werent all that bad
Ill never forget the good times we had
Cause Im reminded every month when I send her the child support
Well it wasnt too long till the lust all died
And Ill admit I wasnt too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin out on the porch
Well I tried to get in
She changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
Goodbye turkey My attorney will be in touch Mhmm
So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do whats right
Give er her fair share
But brother
I didnt know her share was gonna be that much

She got the goldmine She got the goldmine

Midnight in Montgomery Silver Eagle lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Years Eve show
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up I found his name and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots a Nudie suit and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend its good to see you its nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone was he ever really there

Cause its midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
Cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
Hes always singing there

Well I climbed back on that Eagle took one last look around
Through red tail lights a shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan Im so lonesome I could cry

Cause its midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
Cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
Hes always singing there

Yeah hes always singing there
Oh Hanks always singing there
Well now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley

I said Well Ill tell ya one thing judge old buddy old pal
If you wasnt wearin that black robe
Id take out in back of this courthouse
And Id try a little bit of your honor on
You understand that you hillbilly
Who gonna collect my welfare
Pay for my Cadillac
Whadda you mean Contempt of Court
Judge oh judge judgie poo
She said Its just a woman thing and pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry Im an understanding guy
Ive heard that when you love someone you gotta let em go
She hollered When I find myself youll be the first to know
Ooh hoo no news

I learned to do the laundry feed the cat and clean the house
I promised to be patient while she worked her problems out
When she packed her bags her destination wasnt clear
But I sensed that her intentions were honest and sincere
Ooh hoo no news

She could telephone tell a friend tell a lie about where shes been
Send a pigeon send a fax write it on a postit pad
Send a signal up in smoke tap it out in Morse Code
Id prefer a bad excuse to no news

Her mamas been a little vague as to her whereabouts
Her sister says Im certain your romance is headed south
I dont have a single doubt that shes still in love
My level of anxiety is just a product of
Ooh hoo no news

She could telephone tell a friend tell a lie about where shes been
Send a pigeon send a fax write it on a postit pad
Send a signal up in smoke tap it out in Morse Code
Id prefer a bad excuse

She missed her bus missed her plane surely this can be explained
Lost her car at the mall got locked in a bathroom stall
Joined the cult joined the klan on the road with Pearl Jam
Buried with The Grateful Dead came back as a Parrot Head
Got derailed got deiced offered as a sacrifice
FBI CIA if theyve seen her they aint saying
No news
Still no news

If heaven was an hour it would be twilight
When the fireflies start their dancin on the lawn
And suppers on the stove and mammas laughin
And everybodys workin day is done
If heaven was a town it would be my town
Oh on a summer day in 
And everything I wanted was out there waitin
And everyone I loved was still alive
Dont cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if thats what heavens made of
You know I aint afraid to die
If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
So cool and sweet and heavy on your tongue
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
And thered always be enough for everyone
If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
That could take this weary travler round the bend
And if heaven was a tear itd be my last one
And youd be in my arms again
Dont cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if thats what heavens made of
You know I aint afraid to die
Yeah if thats what heavens made of
You know I aint afraid to die
Yeah here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin
He just knock em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos
It aint legal huntin alligator down in the swamp boy

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

About fortyfive minutes southeast of Thibodeaux Lousisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
Thats all he got left cuz alligator bit it
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow

Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou

About fortyfive minutes southeast of Thibodeaux Lousisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Set out on em Amos
Make it count Son
About fortyfive minutes southeast of Thibodeaux Lousisiana
Well its Sunday morning
And the sun in shining in my eye that is open
And my head is spinning
Was the life of the party
I cant stop grinning
I had to much tequila last night
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys
Did I shoot out the lights
Did I dance on the bar
Did I start a fight
Now wait a minute
Things dont look to familiar
Who is this cowboy whos sleepin beside me
Hes awful cute
But howd I get his shirt on
I had to much tequila last night
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys
Did I shoot out the lights
Did I dance on the bar
Did I start a fight
All those little shooters
How I love to drink em down
Come on bartender
Lets have another round
Well the music is playing and my spirits are high
Tomorrow might be painful
But tonight were gonna fly
Did I start any fights
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Every time we get together
I sure have a good time
Youre my friend youre the best mi amigo
Tequila
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys
Did I shoot out the lights
Did I dance on the bar
Did I start a fight
Jose Cuervo you are a friend of mine
I woke up this morning
My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
Well its her way of sayin shes on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin
And I cant even think
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
In this complicated world
It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure
Push to the limit
Im standin at the brink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink

Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
Slambam Im feelin alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Dont need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
All shes gotta do is just give me that wink
He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
Till he said Im here to help you maam
By the way my names Joe
She said Im from St Louis
And Im only passing through
I mustve seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you
When he changed the tire and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said How much do I owe you
Heres what he had to say
You dont owe me a thing
Ive been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way Im helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Heres what you do
Dont let the chain of love end with you
Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldnt help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she mustve been eight months along
And dead on her feet
No she didnt know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitresss eyes
When she read what she wrote
You dont owe me a thing
Ive been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way Im helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Heres what you do
Dont let the chain of love end with you
That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking bout the money
And what the ladys note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
Everythings gonna be alright I love you Joe
La da da da
De de de de de

The moment was custommade to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul

She said
Daddy when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay
Am I gonna see my Grandpa
Can I have a pair of wings
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain
La da da
Da de de de de

Well I wont lie
I pulled that car right over
And I sat there on the shoulder
Trying to dry my misty eyes
And I whispered
Lord I wanna thank you for my children
Cause your innocence that fills them
Often takes me by surprise like

Daddy when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way
Are we goin there to visit
Or are we goin there to stay
Am I gonna see my Grandpa
Can I have a pair of wings
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain

Well I thought about it later on
And a smile came to my face
And when I tucked her in to bed
I got down on my knees and prayed

Lord when I get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way
I dont wanna come to visit
Cause Im coming home to stay
And I cant wait to see my family
And meet Jesus face to face
And do you think Lord
You could use another angel
To help pour out the rain
Mmmm
Can I help pour out the rain
Can I help pour out the rain
La da da da
De de de de
Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom
Red sky faded to black
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didnt care if we were spinnin wheels
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Yeaahee
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin new ground in my back seat
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas
Goin nowhere fast
Goin nowhere fast
You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today
Baby you dont say nothing when youre feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking who is this guy
But they dont think nothing when theyre telling you lies
You look so careless when theyre shooting that bull
Dont you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

Tell me youre trying to cure a sevenyear ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say God I hope he comes back soon

Everybodys talking but you dont hear a thing
Youre still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevards empty why dont you come around
Baby what is so great about sleeping downtown
Splitting your dice to be someone youre not
You say youre looking for something you mightve forgot
Dont bother calling to say youre leaving alone
Cause theres a fool on every corner when youre trying to get home

Tell me youre trying to cure a sevenyear ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say God I hope he comes back soon
Tell me youre trying to cure a sevenyear ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say God I hope he comes back soon
One day shy of eight years old
When grandma passed away
I was a brokenhearted little boy
Blowing out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go
With the cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said dont be sad child
Grandmas watching you today
Cause theres holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin down
Thats how you know shes watchin
Wishin she could be here now
And sometimes if youre lonely
Just remember she can see
Theres holes in the floor of heaven and shes
Watchin over you and me
Seasons come and seasons go
Nothing stays the same
I grew up fell in love
Met a girl who took my name
Year by year we made a life
In this sleepy little town
I thought wed grow old together
Lord I sure do miss her now
But theres holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin down
Thats how I know shes watchin
Wishin she could be here now
And sometimes when Im lonely
I remember she can see
Theres holes in the floor of heaven and shes
Watchin over you and me
Well my little girl is 
I walk her down the aisle
Its a shame her mom cant be here now
To see her lovely smile
They throw the rice I catch her eye
As the rain starts comin down
She takes my hand and says Daddy dont be sad
Cause I know Mommas watchin now
And theres holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin down
Thats how you know shes watchin
Wishin she could be here now
And sometimes when Im lonely
I remember she can see
Yes theres holes in the floor of heaven and shes
Watchin over you and me
Watchin over you and me
Watchin over you and me
I dont know why I keep on believing you need me
When youve proved so many times that it aint true
And I cant find one good reason for staying
Maybe by leaving would be the best for you
But these rose colored glasses
That Im looking through
Show only the beauty
Cause they hide all the truth
And they let me hold on to the good times good lines
The ones I used to hear when I held you
And they keep me from feeling so cheated defeated
When reflections in your eyes show me a fool
These rose colored glasses
That Im looking through
Show only the beauty
Cause they hide all the truth
So I just keep on hopin believin
That maybe by counting the many times that Ive tried
Youll believe me when I say I love you
And Ill lay these rose colored glasses aside
These rose colored glasses
That Im looking through
Show only the beauty
Cause they hide all the truth
I cant hide the way I feel about you anymore
I cant hold the hurt inside keep the pain out of my eyes anymore
My tears no longer waiting my resistance aint that strong
My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And Im tired of pretending I dont love you anymore
Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you
Cause theres no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart cant take the beating not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I cant keep pretending I dont love you anymore
Ive got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life
My tears no longer waiting oohh my resistance aint that strong
But my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And Im tired of pretending I dont love you anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Your mama packed yall up and moved you to the south
Packed a UHaul cross a onetree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didnt know nobody didnt talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now girl I melt when you

Let me light up your world
Street lights along the highway
Throwin shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute

Theres a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think youre goin down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when its rainin
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby I will be your
Baby I will be your parachute
Parachute
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I cant even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love Id known
But you rescued me from reachin for the bottom
And brought me back from bein too far gone

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Ive looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottles always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didnt waste it
Cause theres nothing like your love to get me high

And youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time


Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine
Youre as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
Youre as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey Tennessee whiskey
I used to tear up the roads in this old town
Every bar Id find open Id close it down
That  AM last call man Id answer
Id burn that candle at both ends
Til it met in the middle just smoldering
I was searching for something I didnt even know I was after

Then God made a woman fall for a man
Didnt have much going but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue the clouds parted light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman

Never gave him a reason to bless me at all
And I still cant believe that an angel would fall
For a guy like me guess he sees who needs saving
Every night I hit my knees again thanking the Lord shes a lot like him
She loves me with a grace thats truly amazing

Yeah God made a woman fall for a man
Didnt have much going but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue the clouds parted light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman

He made the moon he made the sun
But the best thing to me that hes ever done
God made a woman
Yeah God made a woman

God made a woman fall for a man
Didnt have much going but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue the clouds parted light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman

When God made a woman
Yeah yeah
God made a woman
If youre gonna play in Texas
You gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot
But not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for Faded Love
And lets all dance
If youre gonna play in Texas
You gotta have a fiddle in the band

I remember down in Houston
We were puttin on a show
When a cowboy in the back stood up
And yelled Cotton Eye Joe
He saidWe love what youre doing
Boys dont get us wrong
Theres just something missing in your song

So we dusted off our boots
And put our cowboy hats on straight
Them Texans raised the roof
When Jeff opened up his case
Say yall all want to twostep
Say you wanna dosdos
Well heres a fiddling song before we go
Why did she have to go
So young I just dont know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason without rhyme
Lovely sweet young woman
Daughter wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin
And I know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin to survive
And understand the why
Feelin so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin that maybe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin
And I know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

Its hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times Ill cherish
And I wont cry cause

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin
And I know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

Dont worry bout me
Dont worry bout me
Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name never read her His Word
Two nonbelievers walkin lost in this world
Took their baby with them what a sad little girl

Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
Shed watch the TV and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep and her Daddy went out

And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch shed be hiding oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom and then took his life

And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said I know that man up there on that cross
I dont know His name but I know He got off

Cause He was there in my old house and held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch the night that my parents died
I read a note my grandma wrote back in 
Grandpa kept it in his coat and he showed it once to me
He said Boy you might not understand but a long long time ago
Grandmas daddy didnt like me none but I loved your Grandma so

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter and this is what it said

If you get there before I do dont give up on me
Ill meet you when my chores are through
I dont know how long Ill be
But Im not gonna let you down darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again
Ill be loving you Love me

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray
I know Id never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her his eyes filled up with tears

He said Ill love you til I die
She told him youll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping shed come back again

He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didnt see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time Id seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon theyll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know she came to see him one last time
Oh and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin through my mind

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon theyll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
Johnnys daddy was takin him fishin
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin a fishin pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said We cant leave her behind
Son I know you dont want her to go
But someday youll change your mind

And Johnny said

Take Jimmy Johnson take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she dont go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please dont take the girl

Same old boy same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said If you do what I tell you to there
Wont be any harm

And Johnny said

Take my money take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Heres the watch that my grandpa gave me
Heres the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please dont take the girl

Same old boy same sweet girl
Five years down the road
Theres gonna be a little one and she
Says Its time to go
Doctor says The babys fine
But youll have to leave
Cause his mommas fadin fast and
Johnny hit his knees

And then he prayed

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
Ill gladly take her place if youll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please dont take the girl

Johnnys daddy
Was takin him fishin

He was working through college
On my grandpas farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah I was caught somewhere
Between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a wellbeaten path
Its funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste of

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since theyve seen a plow
Theres nothing time hasnt touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
Ive been missing so much
Yeah

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Strawberry wine oh
Strawberry wine
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts made the start it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed disassembled rearranged
We came together fell apart
And broke each others hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love we found trust
Vowed wed never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn back its just a steppin stone
To where we are
Where weve been
Said wed do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We wont be sad well be glad
For all the life weve had
And well remember when
You called me up from Amarillo said you were comin to town
And thought Id like to tell you hello and drive an old friend around
I pulled up to the airport confident and cool
But when you stepped off that plane I knew I was your fool
My little Texas tornado blowin me away again
I swore it wouldnt happen again but I looked at you and then
Im like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
Youre blowin me away again
Youre lyin with me in Atlanta its such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano I always let you get by
I know Ill go through hell girl when you find someone else
But right now Im in heaven and I cant help myself
My little Texas tornado blowin me away again
I swore it wouldnt happen again but I looked at you and then
Im like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
Youre blowin me away again
Im like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
Youre blowin me away
Fading
Texas tornado blowin me away again
I swore it wouldnt happen again but I looked at you and then
Im like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
Youre blowin me away
Texas tornado blowin me away again
When I was fourteen I was fallin fast
For a blueeyed girl in my homeroom class
Tryin to find the courage to ask her out
Was like tryin to get oil from a water spout
What she wouldve said I cant say
I never did ask then she moved away
I learned something from my blueeyed girl
Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
The longer I live the more I believe
You do have to give if you wanna receive
Theres a time to listen a time to talk
And you might have to crawl even after you walk
Had sure things blow up in my face
Seen the longshot win the race
Been knocked down by the slammin door
Picked myself up and came back for more
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
Dont worry bout what you dont know
Lifes a dance you learn as you go
Lifes a dance
Lifes a dance
Lifes a dance
Take a chance on love
Lifes a dance
You learn as you go

I sit here surrounded by people and lights
Alone with my drink at the bar
Youve been here forever so clear in my mind
I just dont know where you are
I know Ill find you but girl til I do
This is my love song for you
Lets hold hands on the porch swing under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
Youll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then well dance to the radio right up til dawn
Til you drift off to dream in my arms
You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street
But therell be a hunger deep in your eyes
That Ill recognize when we meet
It might take hours or it might take years
But this is the song you will hear
Lets hold hands on the porch swing under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
Youll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then well dance to the radio right up til dawn
Til you drift off to dream in my arms
She turned up her nose as she walked by my Cadillac
From the corner of my eye I saw you and you laughed
You were sitting on the swing on your front porch
Apainting your nails like you were bored
And you yelled she was sure impressed with you

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

I yelled and asked if you would like a ride
When we pulled out of your yard I bald a tire
You was laughing at me I was doing James Dean
You was the prettiest girl Ive ever seen
When you rolled your eyes and twirled my pink fur dice

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

Well good ol boys dont get no breaks
And the rich boys think they got what it takes
But theres someone for each of us they say

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

Well I aint first class but I aint white trash
Im wild and a little crazy too
Some girls dont like boys like me
Aww but some girls do

I said some girls do
You know some girls do
Like boys like me
You know some girls do
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a tenfoot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn kids and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it aint no use
There aint no paint in the world thatll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
Ah paint it green boy
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters threefoot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
John Deere green
Well I met her out at Murphys
Resturaunt She said she was
Fresh from the farm And I remember
Thinkin for a country girl That she
Went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin by the lobster
Tank I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when them chicken fried streaks arrived
She said I like livin like this

So I made her the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck now shes run off and Ive
Got to trail her dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck
Well a few nights later I run into her
With some stranger on a park bench
She said he rebuilds engines and his
Name is Earl Hes the Charlie Daniels of
The Torque Wrench I whispered honey lets just
Go on home and and have some onion rings and
Watch TV And as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin Dont you leave me

I told him this is the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck sometimes she runs and Ive
Got to trail her dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck

The red wood deck sometimes she runs and Ive
Got to trail her dang her black heart and her pretty

You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
Now youre sorry youre lonesome and scared
And you say youd be happy if you could just come back home
Well heres a quarter call someone who cares

Call someone wholl listen or might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But dont you come around here handing me none of your lies
Heres a quarter call someone who cares

Girl I thought what we had could never turn bad
So your leaving caught me unaware
But the fact is youve run Girl that cant be undone
So heres a quarter call someone who cares

Call someone wholl listen or might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But dont you come around here handing me none of your lies
Heres a quarter call someone who cares
Yeah Heres a quarter call someone who cares
You were the first thing that I thought of
When I thought I drank you off my mind
When I get lost in the liquor
Youre the only one I find
And if I did the things I oughta
You still would not be mine
So Ill keep a tight grip on the bottle
Gettin loose and killin time
This killin time is killin me
Drinking myself blind thinkin I wont see
That if I cross that line and they bury me
I just might find Ill be killin time for eternity
I dont know nothin bout tomorrow
Ive been lost in yesterday
Ive spent all my life just dying For a love that passed away
And if theres an end to all my sorrow
And this is the only price Ill pay Ill be a happy man when I go
And I cant wait another day
Repeat chorus
Ive seen a lot of places
Ive been around the world
Ive seen some pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls
After all Ive witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle you have to see to believe

Cause God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven brother heres your chance
Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
First He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest then on the very next day

Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said Can you help me Creole
I got a little girl waiting on me and I want to treat her right

He said I got what you need son as we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time

You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said Now heres something special
Its just been waiting for a night like tonight

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time

Youre still with me
Weve made some memories
After all these years
Theres one thing Ive found
Some say good love
Is like a fine wine
It keeps getting better
As the days go by

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time
Dont let it fool you
Well I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
Theres something women like about a pickup man
When I turned sixteen I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said I never knew you were a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drivein show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause theres something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and youll know what I mean
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah theres something women like about a pickup man
Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
Id really ever take it this far
Singing in the bars

And chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowds into it lord
It makes this thing Im doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

And chasing that neon rainbow
Ima living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Now daddys got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said son I just know
Were going to hear you singing on it some day
I made it up to Music Row
Lordy dont the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldnt trade a minute
I wouldnt have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

And chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
Because all Ive ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
Im chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honkytonk dream
You see that mountain over there Yeah
Well one of these days Im going to climb that mountain

Oh play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then Ill float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle daze dreaming again


Swim across the river just to prove that Im a man
Spend the day being lazy just being natures friend
Climb a long tall hickory Bend it over skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks using sawmill slabs for bats

Play some backhome comeon music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because thats where music has to start


Oh play me mountain music

Half Cherokee and Choctaw

Shes one of a kind

Cherokee people

So proud to live
So proud to die
Way back up in the country back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Livin with the crazies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
Thats where Im from and Im proud to say
Im from the country and I like it that way
Everybody knows everybody everybody calls you friend
You dont need an invitation kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
Were from the country and we like it that way
All day long we work in the fields
Then bring it on home to a home cooked meal
We love you like Sunday treat you like Saturday night
And when the bed gets full we can sleep in the hay
Were from the country and we like it that way
Everybody knows everybody everybody calls you friend
You dont need an invitation kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
Were from the country and we like it that way
Everybody knows everybody everybody calls you friend

What do you say when its over
I dont know if I should say anything at all
One day were rollin in the clover
Next thing you know we take the fall
Still I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I dont know if words from me can still upset you
But Ive just gotta make this memory stand clear
I know Im leavin here a better man
For knowin you this way
Things I couldnt do before now I think I can
And Im leavin here a better man
I guess I always knew I couldnt hold you
But Id never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old Meant to be
Still Im leavin here a better man
For knowin you this way
Things I couldnt do before now I think I can
And Im leavin here a better man
Yes Im leavin here a better man
For knowin you this way
Things I couldnt do before now I know I can
And Im leavin here a better man
Ooo ooo ooo
Yes Im leavin here a better man
Well its Friday evening six oclock
And all my friends are twisting off
Im at the house just turning on TV
Well they all wonder why Ive changed
How many times must I explain
Its basic honkytonk anatomy

The drinkin bones connected to the party bone
The party bones connected to the staying out all night long
And she wont think its funny and Ill wind up all alone
And the lonely bones connected to the drinkin bone

Hey two plus two is always four
And down is south and up is north
And  degrees is freezing cold
You play with fire you wind up burned
The early bird gets the worm
But the only thing you really need to know

Is the drinkin bones connected to the party bone
The party bones connected to the staying out all night long
And she wont think its funny and Ill wind up all alone
And the lonely bones connected to the drinkin bone

Yeah now sing it with me
Lets make sure you know

The drinkin bones connected to the party bone
The party bones connected to the staying out all night long
And she wont think its funny and Ill wind up all alone
And the lonely bones connected to the
Drinkin bones connected to the party bone
The party bones connected to the staying out all night long
And she wont think its funny and Ill wind up all alone
And the lonely bones connected to the drinkin bone
The Devil went down to Georgia He was lookin for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin on a fiddle and playin it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said Boy let me tell you what
I guess you didnt know it but Im a fiddle player too
And if youd care to take a dare Ill make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy but give the Devil his due
Ill bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think Im better than you
The boy said My names Johnny and it might be a sin
But Ill take your bet and youre gonna regret cause Im the best theres ever been
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hells broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul
The Devil opened up his case and he said Ill start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished Johnny said Well youre pretty good ol son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how its done
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run
The Devils in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite No child no

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnnys feet
Johnny said Devil just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you onceyou son of a bitchIm the best theres ever been
And he played
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run
The Devils in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny will your dog bite No child no
She said Im going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn
Oh have mercy my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off

I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrn
Her closets missing half the things she bought
Yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off

Shell start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

Them pantyhose aint gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off
Whoa

She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

Shell start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

She dont mean nothing
Shes just having fun
Tomorrow shell say Oh what have I done
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh Tequila makes her clothes fall off
I been thinkin about our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
Ive reached the only logical conclusion
Love aint supposed to make sense

This aint no thinkin thing right brain left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
Its a chemical physical emotional devotion
Passion that we cant hold back
Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing

Forget mathematical equations
Selfhelp psychology
Gray matter dont matter much darlin
When its gettin down to you and me oh

This aint no thinkin thing right brain left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
Its a chemical physical emotional devotion
Passion that we cant hold back
Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing

Theres nothin that we need to analyze
There aint no rhyme or reason why
Cause this aint this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing girl no
No this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing
Aint no thinkin thing girl
This aint no thinkin thing baby
This aint this aint this aint no thinkin thing
This aint no thinkin thing
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
Im reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

Then Ill go on loving you
Ill go on loving you
Ill go on loving you

Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I dont know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
From the past
Ooh yeah
Woo yeah
Yeah oh yeah

The only ground I ever owned was stickin to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like thats where it was hung

My blessings arent in front of me
Its not about the land
Ill never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

Theres a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

Ive traveled here and everywhere following my job
Ive seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I cant wait to get back home to the one He made for me

Cause anywhere Ill ever go
And everywhere Ive been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

Theres a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

Ive seen what beautiful is about
When Im looking in
Not when Im looking out

Theres a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
Oh the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in yeah
Oh theres a carrot top who can barely walk
From my front porch looking in
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them oh yeah
Beautiful girl
From my front porch looking in
This is what a woman wants

If you wanna be a man of mine thats right
This is what a woman wants
Going out of my mind these days
Like Im walking round in a haze
I cant think straight I cant concentrate
And I need a shave

I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says Son youre gonna get fired
This aint your style and from behind my coffee cup
I just smile

What a beautiful mess

Spending all my time with you
Theres nothing else Id rather do
What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough
Cant stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful what a beautiful mess Im in
Ahhh

This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Im losing my mind I swear it might be the death of me
But I dont care

What a sweet addiction that Im caught up in
Cause I cant get enough

Ahhh
Ahhh
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said Daddy when you coming home
He said the first thing that came to his mind

Im already there
Take a look around
Im the sunshine in your hair
Im the shadow on the ground
Im the whisper in the wind
Im your imaginary friend
And I know Im in your prayers
Oh Im already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Dont worry about the kids theyll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that Ill be in your dreams tonight
And Ill gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

Im already there
Dont make a sound
Im the beat in your heart
Im the moonlight shining down
Im the whisper in the wind
And Ill be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh Im already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But Ill be with you wherever you are

Im already there
Take a look around
Im the sunshine in your hair
Im the shadow on the ground
Im the whisper in the wind
And Ill be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh Im already there
Oh Im already
There
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But theyre worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But its worth making
Dont let some Hellbent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone
Sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applyin booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose
She said
You dont look like my type but I guess youll do
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
And he said
Ill even tell you that I love you if you want me to
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
When they left the bar
They got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the Family Inn
She didnt even have to pretend she didnt know what for
Then he went to the desk and made his request
While she waited outside
Then he came back with the key and she said
Give it to me and Ill unlock the door
She kept sayin
Ive never really done this kind of thing before have you
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
And he said
Yes I have but only a time or two

Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous

Come come come on baby

I wanna tell you all the story bout
A Harper Valley widowed  wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon
And didnt even stop to play
And she said mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA
Well the note said Mrs Johnson
Youre wearin your dresses way too high
Its reported youve been drinking
And arunning round with men and goin wild
And we dont believe you oughta be abringin up
Your little girl this way
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said Id like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well theres Bobby Taylor sittin there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever hes away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldnt widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well Mr Harper couldnt be here
Cause he stayed too long at Kellys Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompsons breath
Youll find shes had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother Im not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And youre all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldnt put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew shed never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans

I asked her whats a lady like you doing here
I see youre used to champagne but Ill buy you a beer
She said youve got me figured out but Im not what I seem
And for a dance Ill tell you bout these tight fitting jeans

She said I married money Im used to wearing pearls
But Ive always dreamed of being just a good ol boys girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner theres a tiger in these tight fitting jeans

We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through
Im satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans

In my mind shes still a lady thats all Im gonna say
I knew that Id been broken by the time we parted ways
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans

Well now shes back in her world and Im still stuck in mine
But I know shell always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaires dream
And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans
We dont smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We dont take no trips on LSD
We dont burn no draft cards down on Main Street
But We love living right and being free
We dont make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo
We dont let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

And Im proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightnings still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals wont be seen
A footballs still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

And Im proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightnings still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightnings still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee Oklahoma USA
My Maria dont you know Ive come a long long way
I been longin to see her when shes around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
Im a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you

My Maria there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind
Gypsy lady youre a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
My Maria Oh Maria I love you girl Oh my Maria
Maria Oh Maria I love you girl
Maria I love you
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I cant explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together huhn huh
Making love with each other huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
I cant live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together huhn hah
Making love with each other huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
Justa good old boys
Never meanin no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
Straightening the curves
Flatnin the hills
Someday the mountain might get em
But the law never will

Makin their way
The only way they know how
Thats just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

Im a good old boy
You know my momma loves me
But she dont understand
They keep a showing my hands and not my face on TV

OH YEA
Maybe I didnt love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl Im sorry I have tried

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didnt hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Im so happy that youre mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me tell me that your
Sweet love hasnt died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

The Squire remained and read his letter Then he sighed and sat long in meditation At intervals he said
Missouri Missouri Well well well everything is so uncertain
At last he said
For goodness sake Si
And he did
Widow Hopkins kept meI havent any patience with such tedious people Now listen Nancyjust listen at this
Its the same old boy Nancy jest the same old boyaint he
Yes I think theres a little of the old sound about his voice yet I suppose youyoull still go Si
Amen came low and earnestly
Shes been playing in a room on the strip for ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
Shes been readin about Nashville and all the records that everybodys buying
Says Im a simple girl myself grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
Shes gone country look at them boots
Shes gone country back to her roots
Shes gone country a new kind of suit
Shes gone country here she comes
Well the folk scenes dead but hes holding out in the Village
Hes been writing songs speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says I dont believe in money
But a man could make him a killin
Cause some of that stuff dont sound much different than Dylan
I hear down there its changed you see
Well theyre not as backward as they used to be
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
He commutes to LA but hes got a house in the Valley
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just aint on the rally
And he says honey Im a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This aint no place for children
Lord it sounds so easy this shouldnt take long
Be back in the money in no time at all
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country back to his roots
Hes gone country a new kind of suit
Hes gone country here he comes
Yeah hes gone country a new kind of walk
Hes gone country a new kind of talk
Hes gone country look at them boots
Hes gone country oh back to his roots
Hes gone country
Hes gone country
Everybodys gone country
Yeah weve gone county
The whole worlds gone country
Songwriter  Bob McDill

Looking at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Every night now since I been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
Think about you on your mamas front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me
What was I sposed to do
Standing there looking at you
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well theres a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey women music and smoke
Its where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin boogie
Ive got a good job I work hard for my money
When its quittin time I hit the door runnin
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin down that highway to that hideaway
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin boogie

Yeah heel toe dosido come on baby lets go boot scootin
Cadillac blackjack baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Oh get down turn around go to town boot scootin boogie

The bartender asks me says son whatll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin at me
The dance floors hoppin and its hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws inlaws crooks  straights all out makin it shake
Doin the boot scootin boogie

Yeah heel toe dosido come on baby lets go boot scootin
Cadillac blackjack baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Oh get down turn around go to town boot scootin boogie
Blue Kentucky highway
Headin for the line
She hadnt said a word all night but the wheels are turnin in her mind
Now I was ridin shotgun
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

Now Im walkin in the moonlight
Seein nothin but the taillights
And thats a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin me nothin but the taillights
And thats about as lonely as the highways ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

Was it somethin that I did to her
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were
Was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
Im gonna hit every parkin spot around
Til I find that pickup truck

Now Im talkin in the moonlight
Seein nothin but the taillights
And thats a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin me nothin but the taillights
And thats about as lonely as a highways ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind

Well Ill bet right now shes laughin at how
She brought me to my knees
But she wont be laughin half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

Shell be walkin in the moonlight
Seein nothin but the taillights
And thats a pair of taillights she wont ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin but the taillights
And I know thats about as lonely as a highways ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

There she goes
And here I come
Leave me out there in the middle of nowhere
Drive this
I never saw the end in sight fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright but I was running out of time
Because you had one foot out the door I swear I didnt see
But if youre really going away heres some final words from me

Baby write this down take a little note to remind you in case you didnt know
Tell yourself I love you and I dont want you to go write this down
Take my words read them every day keep them close by dont you let them fade away
So youll remember what I forgot to say write this down

Ill sign it at the bottom of the page Ill swear under oath
Cause every single word is true and I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where youll see it for sure


You can find a chisel I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after were gone


Oh I love you and I dont want you to go baby write this down
Charlies got a gold watch
Dont seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of driving up and down the interstate
But Charlies had a good life
And Charlies got a good wife
And after tonight shell no longer be counting the days
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his fourday run
A few more songs from the allnight radio
Then hell spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
Theyll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
Theyll do a lot of catching up a little at a time
With pieces of the old dream
Theyre gonna light the old flame
Doing what they please leaving every other reason behind
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his fourday run
A few more songs from the allnight radio
Then hell spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his fourday run
A few more songs from the allnight radio
Then hell spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
Well excuse me
But I think you have got my chair
No that one is not taken
I do not mind
If you sit here I will be glad to share
Yeah it is usually packed here on Friday nights
Oh if you do not mind
Could I talk you out of a light

Well thank you could I drink you a buy
Oh listen to me what I mean is can I buy you a drink

Oh you are welcome well I do not think I caught your name
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here
Well that makes two of us glad you came

No I do not know the name of the band but they are good
Arent they would you like to dance
Yeah I like this song too it reminds me of you and me
Well baby do you think there is a chance
That later on I could drive you home
No I do not mind at all

Oh I like you too and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all
Oh I like you too and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all
Well I met her out at Murphys
Resturaunt She said she was
Fresh from the farm And I remember
Thinkin for a country girl That she
Went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin by the lobster
Tank I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when them chicken fried streaks arrived
She said I like livin like this

So I made her the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck now shes run off and Ive
Got to trail her dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck
Well a few nights later I run into her
With some stranger on a park bench
She said he rebuilds engines and his
Name is Earl Hes the Charlie Daniels of
The Torque Wrench I whispered honey lets just
Go on home and and have some onion rings and
Watch TV And as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin Dont you leave me

Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck sometimes she runs and Ive
Got to trail her dang her black heart and her pretty

I dont want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy wait too late
I dont care what they say other lovers do

I gotta feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
I just want to dance with you

I want to dance with you twirl you all around the floor
Thats what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you hold you in my arms once more
Thats what they invented dancing for

I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes I did aint that true
You wont get embarrassed by the things I do

So am I and so are you
If this was a movie wed be right on cue
I just want to dance with you


I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
Six short months we went together
Decided it should be forever
Two paychecks are better than one
A diamond ring and it was done
Bought her a house like I said I would
In subdivided neighborhood
The fuse got short and the nights got long
It was over long gone
Before I knew
Where I was headed to
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
I cant believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
Things like this are never final
Im still payin on the vinyl
Flooring in the laundry room
Its multicolored and waterproof
Its a little bit tough to face my friends
The ones that said I jumped in
The river of love a little too soon
That was August
This is June and its a different tune
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
I cant believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
I cant believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the two bedroom
Mortgage is due
Siding light blue palace
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
Im goin through the big D
And dont mean Dallas
SWANN IN LOVE
I shall come on Good Fridayto say goodbye to you for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne
Very well bring your friend if hes nice
  What is this mystery
  I cannot understand it
Or of
  Vision fugitive
  In matters such as this
 Tis best to close ones eyes
But I thought that you were such friends
And on my grandfathers refusal to act as sponsor it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house
Well all right then said M Verdurin he can play just the andante
But my dear I have said absolutely nothing Look here Doctor I call you as a witness did I utter a word
Swann had begun out of politeness to finger the bronzes and did not like to stop
Perhaps thats the man cried Mme Verdurin
Oh no Swann burst out laughing If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldnt put the question
Then to put the question is to solve the problem the Doctor suggested
The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment and that Dr Potain despaired of his life
What cried Mme Verdurin Do people still call in Potain
M Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed all the same to appreciate the pianists aunt
Oh very well just as you like Provided he doesnt fail us at the last moment
Whats that The Elyse Dr Cottard roared in a voice of thunder
Yes at M Grvys replied Swann feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced
Are you often taken like that the painter asked Cottard with mockseriousness
I could dine with you alone somewhere if youd rather she suggested
But what about Mme Verdurin
How charming of you
Dyou mean to say you didnt meet him on the doorstepthe loveliest of Swanns
No M Swann has been here
He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting and ordered his own to follow
What balls
  
Who is that gentleman Forcheville asked Mme Verdurin He seems to speak with great authority
What Do you mean to say you dont know the famous Brichot Why hes celebrated all over Europe
Thats strange remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment
And one make twelve shouted the Doctor wittily but just too late for no one saw the point of his interruption
Its not a Japanese salad is it she whispered turning towards Odette
Who is that lady She seems devilish clever said Forcheville
No it is not But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday
Do you see much of M Swann asked Mme Verdurin
Tell us frankly now what you think of them yourself We shant repeat it to them you may be sure
There cried Odette thats one of the big things I beg him to tell me about and he never will
Oh but protested Swann
Oh but nonsense said Odette
A waterbutt asked the Doctor
Oh dear no Im quite sure they arent the same family said Mme Verdurin desperately
M de Forcheville thinks Odette charming M Verdurin told his wife
Dyou want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M Swann asked the pianist
Forcheville explained the joke to him The Doctor blushed
Youll admit its not bad eh Doctor
Oh Ive known it for ages
Swann bowed politely
No You werent interested she asked dryly
I dont mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid
Yes I know you have your banquet tomorrow I shant see you then till I get home dont be too late
No cattleya then tonight he asked and Ive been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya
But she was irresponsive saying nervously No dear no cattleya tonight Cant you see Im not well
It might have done you good but I wont bother you
Whos that
Yes Mme Verdurin said Odette meekly
But Mme Verdurin has asked me
Thats all right you can quite well go home alone weve left you like this dozens of times said Mme Verdurin
But I had something important to tell Mme de Crcy
Very well you can write it to her instead
Goodbye said Odette holding out her hand
He tried hard to smile but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected

I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours
Oh I do wish I could change you put some sense into that head of yours
But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party
But I know that quintet quite well I can tell you nowthat I adore it
Tell me have you seen your friend M Swann
No my precious Charles I never knew he was here Where is he I must catch his eye
I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked said the Princesse des Laumes
I can throw no light at all on the matter
My dear Princess you here
Yes I tucked myself away in a corner and Ive been hearing such lovely things
What youve been in the room quite a time
Oh yes quite a long time which seemed very short it was only long because I couldnt see you
Mme de SaintEuverte offered her own chair to the Princess who declined it with
Oh but Cambremer is quite a good name old too protested the General
But my dear Princess thats only natural it belonged to their grandparents
My dear Princess you know that theyd be simply wild with joy
Did you notice how dreadfully ill hes looking asked the General
My precious Charles Ah hes coming at last I was beginning to think he didnt want to see me
Mme de SaintEuverte seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann had drifted away
But you are yourself Princess
I Why they must have countries everywhere those creatures Dont I wish I had
It begins no better Swann took the point
Yes that double abbreviation
Some one very angry and very proper who didnt dare to finish the first word
I say Swann Id rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages what do you say
Oh yes of course La Prouse said the General Its quite a wellknown name Theres a street called that
Do you know anyone in the Rue La Prouse asked Swann excitedly
Oh so she lives in the Rue La Prouse Its attractive I like that street its so sombre
I have told you I never did you know quite well she added seeming angry and uncomfortable
Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal
Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that
My darling he began again its all over now was it with anyone I know
No I swear it wasnt besides I think I exaggerated I never really went as far as that
Swann was genuinely astonished for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins presence
Sir it is eight oclock and the barber is here I have told him to call again in an hour
I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day theres always light and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it fallin in the night and fillin up my mind
All the heavens rivers come to light I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just cant believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always calling for you Im fallin for you now
Just like the rain
When the cloud is rollin over thunders strikin me
Its as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldnt see
That its always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess Ive known all along I just belong here with you fallin
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you Im fallin for you now
Just like the rain
And when the night falls on our better days and were lookin to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that well find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin forever well be fallin
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain Always callin for you Im fallin for you now just
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Says shes had enough of me Ive had enough of her too
I might as well go on and set her free shes already turned me loose
No fault no blame nobody done no wrong
Thats just the way it sometimes goes
Sometimes two people just dont get along its time to hit the road
Goodbye farewell so long vaya condios
Good luck wish you well take it slow
Easy come girl easy go
We tried to work it out a hundred times ninety nine it didnt work
I think its best we put it all behind before we wind up getting hurt
No hard feelings darling no regrets
No tears and no broken hearts
Call it quits calling off all bets it just wasnt in the cards
Easy come girl easy go
Vaya condios good luck
Easy come easy go

Baby what do you say we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
Ive got people in Boston aint your Daddy still in Des Moines
We can pack up tomorrow tonight lets flip a coin

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a UHaul van
Couple of modern day Moses searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then well take a look at the map

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

Were gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy were bound to outrun
The bad luck thats been tailing us

Heads Carolina tails California
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where it dont matter as long as were going
Somewhere together Ive got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California
Ohh California Carolina California
verse one
Shes been going out with him
Shes been going out with me
Said shed let us know by tonight which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house and sure enough
Chorus
That aint my truck in her drive
Man this aint my day tonight
Looks like shes in love and Im out of luck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl my whole world
But that aint my truck
verse two
I pulled over by the curb
Ive been sitting here all night
Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right
I thought of breaking down the door
But theres nothing left to say
That Chevy x says it all
Sitting in my place
Chorus
That aint my truck in her drive
Man this aint my day tonight
Looks like shes in love and Im out of luck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
Thats my girl
My whole world
But that aint my truck
Thats my girlmy whole worldrepeat to fade

I saw the light
Ive been baptised
By the fire in your touch
And the flame in your eyes
Im born to love again
Im a brand new man

Well the whole towns talking
About the line Im walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone
I used to have a wild side
They say a countrymilewide
Id burn those beer joints down
Thats all changed now
You turned my life around


I used to love them and leave them
Id brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything Ive ever known
Were right on track
I aint looking back


Im born to love again
Im a brand new man
Delta Dawn
Whats that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Shes fortyone
And her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks round Brownsville say shes crazy
Cause she walks downtown
With her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man
In her younger days
They called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree
Stood by her side
Promised her hed take her for his bride
Delta Dawn
Whats that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn
Whats that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn
Whats that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn
Whats that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Well I got on in Bristol by the old Virginia line
With a suitcase full of dreams
And a brand new spendin dime

I had a bouquet of music wrapped in pretty words
Singin songs sent down from Heaven
On the wings of a speckled bird
Wings of a speckled bird

I heard a guitar and a fiddle banjo and mandolin
An old man opened up the door and told me come on in

He took my ticket then he told me
Bring what it is you do
Cause thats how youll be remembered
When your travelin days are through
When your travelin days are through

They came from the hills and mountains
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle
And some too wild to tame

A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine
Its the same old train its just a different time
Just a different time

We sung songs in war we sung songs in peace
We traveled in abundance and we traveled on relief

From the outer gates of Heaven to hell fires burnin door
It dont matter where you take it
Cause its been there before
Its been there before

They came from the hills and mountains
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle
And some too wild to tame

A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine

Its the same old train its just a different time
Just a different time

Now like a precious treasure thats immeasurable in worth
We stand before a new wave proud children of the earth

Well go on forever and heres your solid proof
As long as theres a world weve gotta sing
Those folks the truth
Sing those folks the truth

They came from the neon cities
The suburbs and the towns
From Bakersfield to Baltimore
Its sacred holy ground

A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine
Its the same old train its just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time


Its the same old train its just a different time
Same old train just a different time
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein made of gold
I dont know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin Amarillo
Takin that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I cant forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Cause leavin didnt hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance Id lie again

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
Id do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
Id never count the cost
Its worth all thats lost
Just to see you smile
I was raised off of Rural Route 
Out past where the blacktop ends
Wed walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnsons fence
Thats where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

Its where I drank my first beer
Its where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Aint just for high achievers
Ive learned Ive come to know
Theres life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didnt like me much
With my shackled up GTO
Id sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
Wed turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

Its where I drank my first beer
Its where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Aint just for high achievers
Ive learned Ive come to know
Theres life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like Ive found a long lost friend

Its where I drank my first beer
Its where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Aint just for high achievers
Ive learned Ive come to know
Theres life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes Ive learned Ive come to know
Theres life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me
In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me
I love your attitude your rose tattoo your every thought
Your smile you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance your drive You make me feel alive
The way you talk the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
Well I was there to buy a pistol
She was there to hauck her ring
The broker in the pawnshop
Deals in almost anything
Hell pay you for your misery
Or hell sell you someones pain
And that twinkle in his greedy eye
Says your loss will be his gain
She stood back in the shadows
As the broker dealt with me
Her eyes were dark and desperate
From some private misery
His words were so prophetic
When he said you got a steal
I said throw in one bullet
And you got yourself a deal
Oh a Saturday night special
Is an easy thing to buy
All you got to be is twentyone
Or fifteen if you lie
Just hand the man money
And if some ones gotta die
The broker in the pawnshop
Wont even blink an eye
Well he handed me the pistol
And I was almost to the door
When I heard him tell the lady
Seven dollars nothing more
The lady started crying
As he took her wedding band
Well my hand was in my pocket
And the gun was in my hand
I was gonna use that bullet
To end my life
I was once somebodys husband
She was once somebodys wife
Well I usually mind my business
But I could not walk away
His dollars just werent making sense
And I knew I had to stay
Well the brokers face turned pasty
When he caught my icy stare
It would never leave my pocket
But he knew the gun was there
I asked him what his life was worth
And he opened up that drawer
For a simple golden wedding band
He paid  more
That Saturday night was special
Even though it wasnt planned
As we walked down the sidewalk
She reached and took my hand
We crossed the bridge and I took that gun
And sailed it through the air
I said Ever been to Texas
She said I think Id love it there
Oh a Saturday night special
Is an easy thing to buy
All you got to be is twentyone
Or fifteen if you lie
But theres a pawnshop in the city
That used to deal in everything
Ha but you cant buy a pistol there
You cant hawk your wedding ring
Appreciate your call
Means a lot and all
Yeah I got a minute
You and me can talk
About anything you want
As long as she aint in it

Say its been at least a month
Since Ive had any fun
Buddy Ill admit it
Yeah Im into going out
Think Im ready for a crowd
As long as she aint in it

Dont wanna hear her name
I dont wanna see her face I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

We could hit that place
Down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she aint in it

Dont wanna hear her name
I dont wanna see her face I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

I can drink and I can dance
I can party I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life wont be the same
As long as she aint in it
As long as she aint in it no
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin for the phone cause
I cant fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Cant stop lookin at the door
Wishing youd come sweeping
In the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

Its a quarter after one Im a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now

Yes Id rather hurt than feel nothin at all

Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldnt call but Im a little drunk and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now
I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
Ive had a change of dreams
Im coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
Ill keep on searching
I cant go on hurting this way
Shes somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
Ive got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn


I cant blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
Ill find her no matter what it takes
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didnt have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said Your Pas run off and Im real sick
And the babys gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
To thine own self be true
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
Across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking mama What do I do
She said Be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
Theyll be nice to you

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well its up to you
Now dont let me down now
Your mamas gonna move you uptown

Well that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I aint been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasnt very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama had been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was going to be a lady someday
Though I didnt know when or how
But I couldnt see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I mightve been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
She said Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down

It wasnt long after that benevolent man took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea In a five room hotel suite Yes she was
I charmed a king congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I aint done bad She aint done bad

Now in this world theres a lot of selfrighteous hypocrites
That call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I aint had to worry about nothing
For now or fifteen years
Well I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mamas voice ringing in my ear

Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Oh heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well its up to you
Now dont let me down honey
Mamas gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did
Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble
And I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble
Even though I had my doubts told myself dont look down
And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel

It was only a mountain nothing but a big ol rock
Only a mountain it aint hard if you dont stop
It just took a little step a right then a left
Then a couple million more whos counting
Yeah thats only a mountain

Well you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber
Cause theres always another one a little bit higher
Just when I think Im finally done Im staring at another one
So I reach down deep and I lace em up tighter

It was only a mountain nothing but a big ol rock
Only a mountain it aint hard if you dont stop
It just took a little step a right then a left
Then a couple million more whos counting
Yeah thats only a mountain

Now Im standing at the top with the sweat behind me
Yeah you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me

It was only a mountain nothing but a big ol rock
Only a mountain it aint hard if you dont stop
It just took a little step a right then a left
Now Im standing at the top just shouting
Yeah thats only a mountain
Its only a mountain its only a mountain
Only a mountain
Only a mountain it was only a mountain

Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was bout to be

Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Moonlight all night crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat ayy

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Moonlight all night crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah girl you and I were
Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat

Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Moonlight all night crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah girl you and I were
Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Sunrise sunburn sunset repeat
Mary took to running with a travelling man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case so broken hearted
She say momma gotta go gotta get outta here
Gotta get outta town tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches
Just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows
But the highway goes on forever
That ol highway rolls on forever

Lord she never wouldve done it if she hadnt got drunk
If she hadnt started running with a travelling man
If she hadnt started taking those crazy chances
She say daughter let me tell you bout the travelling kind
Everywhere hes goin such a very short time
Hell be long gone before you know it
Hell be long gone before you know it

She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight

This is down in the swampland anything goes
Its alligator bait and the bars dont close
Its the real thing down in Louisiana
Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter goin bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
The stranger better move it or hes gonna get killed
Hes gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It aint no time for lengthy speeches
There aint no time for lengthy speeches


Just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows
But the highway goes on forever
That old highway rolls on forever
Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble
And I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble
Even though I had my doubts told myself dont look down
And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel

It was only a mountain nothing but a big ol rock
Only a mountain it aint hard if you dont stop
It just took a little step a right then a left
Then a couple million more whos counting
Yeah thats only a mountain

Well you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber
Cause theres always another one a little bit higher

So I reach down deep and I lace em up tighter

Now Im standing at the top with the sweat behind me
Yeah you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me

It was only a mountain nothing but a big ol rock
Only a mountain it aint hard if you dont stop
It just took a little step a right then a left
Now Im standing at the top just shouting
Yeah thats only a mountain
Its only a mountain its only a mountain
Only a mountain
Only a mountain it was only a mountain
I dont take my whiskey to extremes
Dont believe in chasing crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darling when you come around

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride Im on baby Im long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day I get carried away

It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol stars the same ol moon up high
But when I see you standing at your door
Nothings ordinary anymore

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride Im on baby Im long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day I get carried away

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride Im on baby Im long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day I get carried away
Carried away

Hey
I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
To that old flame that burns inside of me
She cried when I left her now I cry to forget her
Oh how foolish I was to ever want to leave

Because nobody in his right mind would have left her
I had to be crazy to say goodbye
Nobody in his right mind would have left her
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

I still carry her picture I wish her well
With the new love I know she is found by now
Each night finds me dreaming each day I spend thinking
How much I wish she was still around


Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind
I knew the first time shouldve been the last time
I ever let the whiskey touch my lips
Cause the devil wears black and he goes by Jack
And hes really good at helpin me forget
I thought it was cool when I was a kid
Walkin around with that cigarette lit
On that ol dirt road I lit my first smoke
And I knew right then it wouldnt let me go

And its all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Aint no stopping keep on rocking yeah
It seems Im always
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put down
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put cant put cant put down

She looked my way then looked back again
Gotta different kinda high when I touched her skin
When she laid it on me she rocked my world
I knew Id never get away from that girl

And its all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Aint no stopping keep on rocking yeah
It seems Im always
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put down
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put cant put cant put down

When I walked into my first smoky bar
Cranked up the amp and played this guitar
Had em singing along by the end of the night
And I knew I finally got one thing right

And its all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Aint no stopping keep on rocking yeah
It seems Im always
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put down
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put down
Yeah Im always
Picking up what I cant put cant put cant put down
Yeah yeah I wanna put it down
Like a rainy Sunday mornin
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
Youre my inspiration girl
You take me places put the words right into these songs

Stealin kisses under cover babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
Youre my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half my savin grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers angel
Yeah Im down for life you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you cant tell

Im finding out how hot an old flame can burn
Youre a feeling I havent forgot
The love I cant unlearn
Youve become a memory I cant live without
Youll always be a fire I cant put out

I dont know how to handle the dream you left behind
Its like a lighted candle burning up my mind
At least Im happy knowing what love is all about
Youll always be a fire I cant put out

Embers to ashes
Thats how it should be
Youd think by now my heart would know
And it could set you free
The things Ive tried
The tears Ive cried
I guess theres no doubt
Youll always be a fire I cant put out


Youll always be a fire I cant put out
Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she aint a fooling me

She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

We ride back and forth til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said shes got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy

Well she isnt into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere man her eyes light up

She thinks my tractors
She thinks my tractors sexy
It really turns her on
Shes always staring at me
While Im chugging along
She likes the way its pulling while were tilling up the land
Shes even kind of crazy bout my farmers tan
Shes the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractors sexy
She thinks my tractors sexy
She thinks my tractors sexy
Hes gross shes got cooties
Thats just how its supposed to be
He hates dumb tea parties
And she wont climb a tree

Its a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

Shell stop wearin pigtails
And get the braces off her teeth
Hell stop makin faces
And start savin her a seat

Its a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

Shell start wearin makeup
And hell start noticin the curves
Theyll get a little nervous
When shes with him and hes with her

Is he gonna kiss me
Wonder if she wants me to
Awkwardly embarrassed
Not sure what to do

Its a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing


Theyll throw around I love yous
Start makin plans to say I do
Start a brand new life together
And probably have some babies too

Theyll fight and act like children
And make up like theyre seventeen
And even when theyre eighty
Its still gonna be

A boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

A girl and a boy thing
A boy and a girl thing

As Im walkin out the door
Take this job and shove it

Well I been working in this factory
For now on fifteen years
All this time I watched my woman

If I had the guts to say

Take this job and shove it

My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was working for

When I get the nerve to say

Take this job and shove it

My woman done left and took all the reasons

Im east bound just watch ol Bandit run
My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

In thirteen years Id never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
Ive learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldnt feel his legs
Said hed never walk again

But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
Ive learned to never underestimate the impossible

So dont tell me that its over
Dont give up on you and me
Cause theres no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
Ive learned to never underestimate the impossible

I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didnt matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like Id rehearsed
And then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

And he said Let me tell you a secret about a fathers love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said Daddies dont just love their children every now and then
Its a love without end amen its a love without end amen

When I became a father in the spring of 
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my fathers son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddys secret and I passed it on to him


Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things Ive done theyll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
Well Ive been afraid of changing
Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
Im getting older too
Well
Well Ive been afraid of changing
Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
Im getting older too
Well Im getting older too
So take this love and take it down
Yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Well maybe
Well maybe
Well maybe
Landslide will bring you down
Ive seen a lot of places
Ive been around the world
Ive seen some pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls
After all Ive witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle you have to see to believe

Cause God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven brother heres your chance
Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
First He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest then on the very next day

Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well Ive been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Weve been up
All night long
Trying to solve a problem
Hell its almost dawn
Aint no time for sleepin
If our love is wearin thin
Cause I aint givin up
And you aint givin in

Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away
Cause the life weve been livin
Gets harder everyday
Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away

A wounded love
Walks a real thin line
And no communication
Will kill it every time
So open up your heart
Baby we can work it out
Cause weve got the kind of love
People dream about

Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away
Cause the life weve been livin
Gets harder everyday
Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away

Its past the point of right or wrong
Lets find a way to just hold on

Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away
Cause the life weve been livin
Gets harder everyday
Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away
Dont let our love start slippin
Love start slippin away
Look what you have overcome to get here
Look at the distance youve run
The doubts that youve pushed down
Fear that youve drowned out
When they said that it couldnt be done

In your head in your heart in your hands
In your head In your heart in your hands
In your head in your heart in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

All of the words that you left in your throat
All of the dreams unlocked
Now you can finally see them
They meet you at your destination
Now that you have made it so far

In your head in your heart in your hands
In your head in your heart in your hands
In your head in your heart in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

It dont define you
Gravity will lie to you lie to you

Tell them to never let go
There is a beautiful valley below
When you hold on so tightly to the dream
Gravity is just a fragile thing
First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold
Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove
And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasnt just a boy no more
When she moved in next door
Where you from
Whats your name
Wanna go to my game
Got the keys to my dads old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love
The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasnt livin for myself
I knew i wasnt fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do
Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldnt talk
Couldnt breathe
My heart had me all choked up
Said I do
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love
Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said Its time to watch your miracle arrive
Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love
Spent fortyeight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
Shes got me sayin sugarpie honey darlin and dear
I aint seen the Braves play a game all year
Im gonna get fired if I dont get some sleep
My long lost buddies say Im gettin in too deep

But I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in til that girl got a hold of me
Now Im holdin umbrellas and openin up doors
Im takin out the trash and Im sweepin my floors
Im crossin my fingers and countin every kiss
Prayin that it keeps goin on like this

Cause I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa shell move a little closer
She cant get enough of me

Yeah I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

Come on baby
You know what I like
Yeah I like that
Mmm mmm mmm
Hey dont forget to turn out the lights
Who doesnt know what Im talking about
Whos never left home whos never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girls dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her she hasnt yet guessed

She needs
Wide open spaces spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new
New faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wideeyed and grinning she never tired
But now she wont be coming back with the rest
If these are lifes lessons shell take this test

She needs
Wide open spaces spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new
New faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes

Aahhh aahhh aahhh
Aahhh aahhh aahhh

As her folks drive away her dad yells Check the oil
Mom stares out the window and says Im leaving my girl
She said It didnt seem like that long ago
When she stood there
And let her own folks know

She needed
Wide open spaces spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new
New faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
She knows the highest stakes

Wide open spaces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
Wide open spaces
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought aw shell be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall an said

That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said give it away
Just give it away
And I said now honey dont you even want
Your half of everything
She said give it away
Just give it away

Just give it away
There aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away


So Im still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She dont care about anymore
Mmm like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away
And that big fourposter kingsize bed
Where all our love was made
She said give it away
Well I cant give it away

Ive got a furnished house a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I cant even give it away
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around Ill always be around and around and around and
Around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
Ill find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And Ill be back again and again and again and again and again
Hey baby whatcha doin this evening
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks
I got Tom Petty playin in my Silverado
And I iced down a sixpack uhoh
Hey Daisy dont you worry bout your mama
Like  we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth

Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin wildflowers
Hey baby Mother Nature is waitin
And loves bloomin like a cherry tree
Lets buzz around maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees

Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby wont you come with me

Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time pickin wildflowers
Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby You and me baby
Pickin wildflowers
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Pickin wildflowers
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies In Southern sky
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin willows would cry for joy joy

Feels so good
Feels so good its frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
Ladadadada ladadadadada dadadadadada dadada dadada

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good its a frightening
Wish I could Southern nights
Stop this world from the fighting
Dadadadada dadadadadada dadadadadada dadada dadadada dadadadadada

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed
